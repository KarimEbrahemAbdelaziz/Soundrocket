The album is another magical piece of work that focuses on melody and rhythm, on fat bass and vivid sound design and is a truly captivating journey through the mind, music, body and soul of one of dance musicâ€™s truly modern greats. After its release, a great team of modern music makers was enlisted to remix tracks from it: Maceo Plex & Shall Ochin, Fur Coat, Extrawelt, long time musical sparring partner Marc Romboy, Pan-Pot, Max Cooper, Agents of Time, Dominik Eulberg and many more all contributed to what is an essential collection. With a remix of â€˜Sleeplessâ€™, a Pan-Pot track from their latest album, Stephan Bodzin closed the latest chapter of 2015 in what has been an exhilarating musical journey in his capable and creative hands.",

        "description": "Here's Alex's and my oral history of this track..\n\nAlex:  \"The idea for â€˜Eveâ€™ came about from a short session in my studio where I sketched out some very rough 16 bar loops and sent them over to Max to play with, deliberately stopping myself from developing them too far at this stage in order to leave space the collaborative process to evolve.\"\n\nMax:  \"I almost un-wrote a track for this one. Alex started off with the main bulk of the ideas for the track, and I initially chopped it all back to a couple of key elements.   I then experimented with some FFT effects and building some chaotic randomising manipulations of the basic elements, and sliding drum rhythms so that one drum element would slip relative to another and then back in - all an attempt to generate some movement and variation from the simple building blocks.\"\n\nAlex:   \"It was interesting to hear the rough ideas I had created, developed in a totally different way to how they would have had I been writing the track by myself. Inspired by the new direction the track was going in - \"\n\nMax:  \"I'd made a mess.  Alex helped tidy it all up and bring it enough back into line to work as a dancefloor track\"\n\nAlex:  \"- I layered some more percussion hits and string textures.  We continued the process of sending stems back and forth, refining each others ideas as well and creating new ones until the track was ready.\"\n\nMax:  \"The quotient series has been a nice opportunity to experiment with new music outside of the restrictions of record labels and their need to sell product.  This freedom has left me open to put out a piano solo and feedback matrix, a 10 minute ambient to drum and bass glitch remix, a track scored to a video, a one off club collab and more - all projects that I wanted to try, and am glad I did, but that wouldn't easily fit into the usual EP/LP formats. \n\nIt's been a sort of sketch and experiment project, much of it tied to the Emergence visual shows, where I've been experimenting with how I can perform music and visual in sync in a live format. \"\n",

        "description": "This track started with a visit to the pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico. A beautiful place, but a place where a lot of the original culture and knowledge that created the pyramids has been lost, and replaced with a rebuilt, tourist trap.\n\nSo it's a mix of loss and sadness and beauty with an edge of modern misuse, which I tried to capture in the original strings from which the track was built. I also made some binaural recordings of the sounds there, and a storm which came in, to give a real layer of atmosphere from the actual location. Tom Hodge then played piano to these elements, bringing the whole piece to life.\n\nI loved the piano on it's own in addition to the strings version, so as well as the Part 2 on the EP, we also created a Part 1 piano solo version with the piano sent into a feedback matrix with lots of randomising to create unusual textures. This part 1 version can be downloaded for free from www.maxcooper.net as part of the Quotient Series.",

        "description": "I wanted part of my Emergence show to be about the emergence of the human machine, with an infographic-style visual tour of the different modules of the human body - lungs, heart, blood vessels, brain, and more. Henning M. Lederer, who created the amazing video to \"Numb\", took on the project and created some beautiful video content, and I then created the music to match.\n\nAnatomic is now the fifth free download in the Quotient series - original pieces of music, remixes and mixes that are free just for you.\n\nDOWNLOAD: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nAnatomic was created in an unusual way for me, as a scored part of my new Emergence audio-visual show.\n\nHenning's work is hand drawn, and this video work was also colourful, so I made the music quite playful and lighter than my usual - to match the fun, but also full of meaning, visual content. This section of Emergence also shows the mechanical, ongoing, cyclical nature of the workings of the human body, so I applied the same reasoning to the music, with many melodic and rhythmical loops of different lengths and forms, which create interesting syncopation effects as they interact in a continuous flowing structure, without breaks or stops.\n\nAnatomic is very much a piece of music most at home in the live show, I hope you can join me to see it sometime!",

        "description": "\" I'm a huge fan of Max's production and this was no different. I've never received so many stems for a remix.\n\n I found this arpeggiated piano part at the end of the track which sounded great looped up. I really wanted the track to build and then have a big pay off, kind of like setting it free from the cleverly edited structure of the original.\n\nThere is so much emotion to the original and I wanted to keep that vibe but sounding more live which we've adapted for the live show with love drums and guitars.\"\n\n. Nick Cobby has taken the concept further with an amazing music video, coming soon!\n\nPre-order the EP or get Remnants now > hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP",

        "description": "I've been listening to Essential mixes since I first started getting into clubs and electronic music, so it was a shock, and exciting for me, to get the offer to make one myself. The two hour format really allows some time to explore ideas musically as well.\n\nSo bringing everything together, I decided to try and make it an exploration of everything that has made me so obsessed with electronic music for the last 20 years, with some of my favourite records from the mid 90's, unreleased material from my favourite artists like Nils Frahm, Lusine, Tim Hecker and Rob Clouth, and a range of genres from ambient to 90 bpm electronica, house and techno, all the way up to 170bpm glitched jungle mayhem - I thought, why not have some fun with it!?\n\nSo it's certainly not a normal club mix, it's just what I think is the best music out there, without worrying about what genre or box any particular track fits into or how things should be done \"properly\". I wanted to leave some sections quite ambient as well, to give breathing space between the peaks, so I'm happy to be able to post this new version up, minus the broadcast talking and idents.\n\nThe mix also contains some new work from me, some unreleased, and two tracks from my new EP with Tom Hodge, one of which you can download for free from here www.maxcooper.net, the other you can download from iTunes - http://hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP - or Beatport - http://btprt.dj/1DHZhHk\n\nTrack List\n\n1.

        "description": "I've been working on some new music with Tom Hodge, combining piano and electronic elements - the first track preview is below, with the full release coming 20th April.\n\nFor this track we made the drums from clanging around inside a broken piano, and then applying some complex editing, so they have an interesting partially live feel, even though rhythmically they are very electronic.\n\nThe piano came from a live jam over an initial chord structure, then lots of editing to find that one simple little hook in there. It felt like a reflective piece of music to me, invoking memories, so we chose \"remnants\". Nick Cobby has taken the concept further with an amazing music video, coming soon!\n\nPre-order the EP or get Remnants now > http://hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP",

        "description": "When I was touring in Mexico, I was lucky enough to have some days off during a visit to Mexico City, and took a trip to a nearby Toltec/Aztec Pyramid site called Teotihuacan. It's a beautiful place, but when I asked about its history I was told that most of the knowledge and culture of the people who built it was lost, with the arrival of the Europeans. Now it's turned into a rebuilt money making tourist trap, with the loss of its real meaning.\n\nI recorded the space and sounds there with binaural mics, so I could try and capture some of the feeling of it, including a storm which came in, and then I wrote a strings part inspired by the feelings of the visit there. Tom Hodge brought the piece to life by playing a piano part in addition, and I loved the piano so much I decided to make two parts, the first with the piano only, combined with the binaural recordings and a randomising delay feedback network, and the second part with the strings. The first part of Teotihuacan is available exclusively from the free download Quotient Series, and the second part will be coming on the Artefact EP in April.\n\npreorder available - www.smarturl.it/ArtefactEPâ€",

        "description": "FREE DOWNLOAD HERE: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\nÂ \nYour DecemberÂ free download is a remix, and an important piece of music to me personally. Partly because it was the result of a chance string of events driven by my love of the original track and a fortuitous meeting with Frederic D. Oberland, one half of The Rustle of the Stars with Richard Knox. And partly because I love the intensity and feeling of the original which I have tried to convey in my own way with little regard for the usual rules of making music - ambient strings arrangement at one end, and a drum and bass wall of sound at the other, because that's what I felt was required to communicate the emotions I found in the originalÂ piece, inspired by \"a musical passage through the North Pole explorer diaries\".Â Â \nÂ \nHere's what Richard and Frederic said about the original:Â  \"We would like to think of this as a polar journey to the ends of the earth through the arctic sea. We kept in mind the first polar expeditions, Edgar Allan Poe's Dream-Land, the ships trapped or crushed by ice, the point of no-return, the minds sinking, the attempt on the Pole ending in disaster, the quest of the Northwest Passage, Erebus & Terror, the Mercy Bay, Mangazeya, Charles Francis Hall, Beechey Island, the Midnight sun and the Polar night.\"\nÂ \nIt's very winter-y.Â And I'm very pleased Richard and Frederic agreed to allow me to give the remix away for free to anyone who would like to hear it this Christmas!\n\nThe Rustle of the Stars - Sleeping Land (Part 1) - Max Cooper Remix\n\nYou can find the beautiful full album from the Rustle of the Stars, here: http://www.therustleofthestars.com/ ",

        "description": "Iâ€™ve been pretty obsessed with simple ratios in the forms of chord progressions for as long as I can remember, hence all the long sustained chords in my music - for some reason I find chords even more satisfying in the lower frequencies, maybe we can pick out the ratios more clearly when theyâ€™re using slower wave fronts like with bass. I also love melodies and rhythms that combine different loop lengths so that interesting syncopation effects arise as a result of the ratios between the loop lengths. A lot of my favourite new tracks recently have used these types of techniques, so I decided to base a mix around them - Semiosis.\n\nSemiosis is a process by which we create meaning from comparison. If I tell you a made up word that doesnâ€™t relate to anything you know, you can get little meaning from it - meaning comes from what something isnâ€™t, how it relates to other things you know. Music works in exactly this way, with us comparing meaningless wave frequencies to find feeling in how one value relates to another - a ratio.\n\nWhether or not you like it, your subconscious mind is a massive maths geek, and it gets really excited when it finds a 1:3:5 ratio in the stream of air pressure information being received by your ears.  Ratio has the capacity to make us feel and make us dance. But it all happens without us being aware of it. \n\nWhen you listen to long drawn out chords and syncopating rhythms however, you canâ€™t really get the full feeling from just a quick dip in, I find that it needs time for the ratios to wash over and sink in. The more time you give to it the more beauty you can find hidden in there. So the mix is very much of this long form, it doesnâ€™t jump from one extreme to another like some of my other mixes, and needs to have some time to develop.\n\nThis is part 2 of 6 from the Quotient Series, all of which can be downloaded for free in return for signing up to my new download website, built specifically for bringing you new original tracks, remixes and mixes, which you won't be able to get from anywhere else. \n\nYou can find the website here: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nMax Cooper - Semiosis - DJ Set - Quotient 2/6\n\n1.

        "description": "iTunes - http://smarturl.it/MCKindred\nA few years ago I did a remix of a track by Dominik Eulberg called Sansula, which featured an instrument of the same name. After the release a builder of sansula instruments in the Netherlands was kind enough to give me one as a present in case I wanted to use one again in a live recording, which I have finally got around to doing now with this track!\n\nMy process consisted of me sitting in my studio (badly) playing the thumb plucked sansula for quite a while, so that I could go back to the recording and pull out some useable loops as a starting point. I wanted a nice warm analogue chord progression to complement, but more in the high bass and low mids than my usual chord progression that's down really low, to fill the mix with the warmth as much as possible.\n\nThe track still needed something though, so I turned to some spare recordings of my favourite vocalist - Kathrin deBoer, from some of our previous recording sessions. I didn't want to go for the usual full lyrical approach of a vocal collab track, I just wanted to add some small snippets of human feeling to round off the track properly.\n\nThe release is coming out on Fields on the 1st of December along with an intense synth experiment with a Prophet 08, and beautiful remixes from David August and Throwing Snow.\n\nIf you're not into buying music there is also a new website I have just launched which will be providing exclusive new free downloads for all in return for signing up to the website - http://www.maxcooper.net/downloads",

There will be 6 parts, and every one of them will be free for members of the site.\n\nThis first track, called Arc, was one of my first experiments with some new analogue synths recently - the Moog Minituar, and the Dave Smith Instruments Prophet 08. I wanted to make something smooth and melodic which would work for my club sets, and would be mixable, but nothing too peak time intense, something a little softer. I think the heart of the track really all came down to squeesing the main riff with those lovely analogue filters!\n\nIf you would like to download this track, and receive promos of the rest of the new music before it goes public, then just click on the download button on the soundcloud player and all will be explained. In return for your email you will receive all 6 parts of the series for free, and they will not be released on any other platforms.\n\nThanks to Rabbithole for the excellent art work!",

This one was much more of an ambient venture, where I've added lots of reverb and delay to Kathrin's vocal and Quentin's trumpet, to try and blend them into the airy pads and create a feeling of space. \n\nI added a high end squeal that sounded to me like an army of crickets in a hot country at dusk, hence the name of the track. \n\nThe whole EP is out now on gearbox records on vinyl and digital, with the more beat driven a-side, another ambient experiment, and some sort of abomination of a piece of music called theatre of the absurd.\n\nDigital: http://smarturl.it/chronology\nVinyl: http://gearboxrecords.wazala.com/products/max-cooper-feat-kathrin-deboer-quentin-collins%E2%80%A8/",

        "description": "What happens if you take 3 great jazz musicians, put them in recording studio, and throw electronic music at them?\n\nThis project was an experiment into exactly that, with my long running collaborator Kathrin deBoer on vocals, and the greatest trumpet player I've yet to hear - Quentin Collins, with Jack Stevens on bass for this one track from the EP too. \n\nWe made some recordings where Kathrin and Quentin played at the same time, which was really interesting - I love the way you can hear Kathrin and Quentin almost talking to each other during the track, they sort of imitate and bounce off each other as they go along. They were having a lot of fun during the recordings and I think it comes through.\n\nThe fun we were having making the recordings was aided by the fact that Gearbox records (who are releasing the EP 6th Oct on vinyl, and 3rd Nov on digital) had provided Mark Ronson's recording studio for us to work in, so it was a pleasure all round.\n\nThere are 3 more tracks to come from the release, 2 ambient, and one absolute abomination where I wanted to see what would happen if I made the most f*&ked up track I could and then asked them to improvise over it - more clips and info coming soon.\n\nIf you want to catch Quentin Collins playing, he does regular gigs in London at Ronnie Scotts, amongst other places. And Kathrin deBoer has also launched a new solo project under her name, which is also touring and highly recommended.",

The first vinyl + digital release coming next week on Berlin's Killekill label. No pretty melodies this time.

        "description": "From the original feature on Clash Magazine: http://www.clashmusic.com/features/fluid-landscapes-exclusive-max-cooper-mix\r\n\r\nItâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve made a full length â€œliveâ€ mix of just my own material, mainly because I was focused on my album in recent times. But after some new studio additions and work developing new ideas and new experiments, Iâ€™ve got enough fresh material to draw on, along with some old, to put together a new live set only composed of my originals, some remixes Iâ€™ve done, and I had to include a couple from the Inhuman remix package because thereâ€™s some great work on there from Lusine and Rodriguez Jr. among others.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve approached this mix a little more like my live sets of old, keeping it pretty smooth and letting the tracks do the talking, rather than going too heavy on the genre-swapping and BPM-juggling as I have been doing on other mixes recently. Thereâ€™s still some (hopefully) unexpected moments though of course, a strings solo, some crunchy glitch, backwards Nyatiti, several brand new never heard before tracks, a homemade desolation bootleg of Spastik, my first ever totally analogue tracks (Iâ€™ve only recently taken the plunge into the analogue synth world), and two live Jazz improvisation sessions recorded recently in London.\r\n\r\nThe artwork embedded is made by Andre Britz, who has literally created some \"fluid landscapes\" works, of which he was kind enough to donate a custom piece for this mix - Thanks Andre! You can find him here: https://www.behance.net/Andre\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the mix is about being wrapped up in a warm exploration of feelings and landscapes. It will work best with a nice pair of headphones and an open mind. I hope thereâ€™s at least some parts in there you enjoy!\r\n\r\n1. Max Cooper - TBA1\r\n2. Collaboration - TBA2\r\n3.

        "description": "NOW AVAILABLE ON INHUMAN TWO:  http://bit.ly/InhumanTWO\r\n\r\nThe original really spoke to me because of the brilliant use of acoustic instruments, Max used the traditional instruments to turn it into a psychedelic ambient piece. The first time I listened to it, it immediately inspired me to chop it up and turn it all around. I always try to really honor the original by making the remix highly recognizable but also make something totally new with it. In my own music I am always pretty focused on harmonies so the beautiful melodies in 'Woven Ancestry' made it very easy for me to work with.\r\n\r\nSo I kept true to the chords and added my personal flavor to it. The timing on the other hand was a bigger challenge, after a couple of hours of cutting and pasting I came to a result that was something I could work with. I chose to take a triplet approach to give the track a laidback feel and still give it a danceable tempo, without making the melodies too chaotic and rushed. The main idea was to keep the track organic; I used acoustic drums, a fretless bass and my own voice to give it a more human feel. I added the somewhat haunting pads to make a nice contrast between the rhythmical harps, koraâ€™s and celloâ€™s Max used so well.\r\n\r\nThe track became a long and stretched piece, in the hope it would be a small journey, just like the original. I hope you like it, enjoy! ",

        "description": "INHUMAN ONE out now on Fields > http://www.beatport.com/release/inhuman-one/1280972\r\n\r\nSo, I did an album, and it was time to find some remixers, so I got in touch with a few of my absolute favourite producers in the world, and luckily for me, some of them were interested in getting involved with the release. In fact, we ended up with such a great bunch of remixes, we decided to split them into two packages, so we could all take in each one of their works with enough time for the proper consideration they deserve.\r\n\r\nThis time we have Lusine, Rodriguez Jr and Harvey McKay. Lusine is one of my all-time-favourite producers, and has been for many years. His \"A Certain Distance\" LP being one of the most listened to albums in my collection, and his use of detail, complexity, warm synths and beautiful melodies, a big inspiration for me over the years.\r\n\r\nRodriguez Jr has always featured heavily in my DJ sets, with his soft and massive at the same time productions, and a knack for writing tracks that seem to work anywhere in the world and on any sound system - that is f'ing hard to do!....He's a master of tight productions, as demonstrated by his beautiful remix of Supine on this release - hats off to Olivier.\r\n\r\nHarvey McKay has basically stamped on everyone in the last year or two (in the best possible way!) with his brand of crunchy saturated techno hugeness. He's got some amazing way of making this rolling wall of sound that's got aggression and groove in a lovely balance - if you ever hear this remix of his on a big system it all becomes clear!",

        "description": "Out Now! >> http://www.beatport.com/release/inhuman-one/1280972\r\n\r\nLusine has been one of my favourite producers for a long time. I'm just going back over some of his first releases on Ghostly International from the early 00's, and it's amazing how ahead of the game he's always been. His combination of delicate productions and beautiful warm analogue melodies, intricacies and amazing shuffling grooves have been a big inspiration for me over the years, with his \"A certain distance\" album from 2009 being one of my all-time most listened too albums.\r\n\r\nSo Lusine was one of my ideal remixers for the album, and thanks to Sean at Decibel festival, the hookup was made and he was into the idea. He's turned out a beautiful remix of Woven Ancestry, which if you've seen me play recently, you probably heard in my set. The mix has special balance of being a great piece of music to listen to at home, but then when it's unleashed in a club it's groove takes on a whole new life which I hadn't seen coming until I tried it out - Thanks Jeff!\r\n\r\nMax",

I wanted to try and make something purely noisy and intense, but always delivering a feeling that 100 times more power was still fighting to get out, like the potency of human nature. After deciding on a basic chord structure, it was just a matter of layering and layering, which gave an interesting interference result, you can hear the different waves interacting to give beating patterns.\r\n\r\nThe layers were made from some Operators in Ableton with Guitar Rigs and Saturators, plus a Moog Minitaur with a fast LFO with high resonance, plus Andy Ramsayâ€™s overdriven guitar amps and speakers re-recorded, plus Phil Kieranâ€™s tape saturation/distortion - itâ€™s basically a right mess! You can even hear some of the leftovers on Philâ€™s tape at the end, with him speeding it up and slowing it down. Interestingly, that Moog on there was the only analogue synthesiser used in the whole album, the rest was all sourced digitally, albeit with some subtle analogue compression and analogue mixing desk throughs at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome album press:\r\n\r\n\"Incredibly intense\" - Pitchfork\r\n\r\n\"Insanely good\" - The FADER\r\n\r\n\"Impossibly gorgeous\" - FACT\r\n\r\n\"Burns with an incredible creative intensity ... sumptuous, enticingly beautiful\" - Clash\r\n\r\n\"Wants you to dance and cry simultaneously, and will probably succeed in doing so\" - DUMMY\r\n\r\n\"Ace\" - theQuietus\r\n\r\n\"A religious experience .. a master at blending blissed-out, lightweight textures with moments of heavy darkness\" - Earmilk\r\n\r\n\"Recalls Philip Glass, Aphex Twin's most serene moments and even Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3\" - Resident Advisor\r\n\r\n\"A quiet elegance that's unique to the genre\" \r\n- XLR8R\r\n\r\n\"Some of the more ambitious and exploratory music crafted within the last few years\" \r\n- The Music Ninja\r\n\r\n\"One of today's most innovative electronic musicians\" - DJZ",

Closing your eyes helps. Relax and let yourself naturally build a mental picture of your surroundings based only on what you hear.\r\n\r\nABOUT 4D SOUND\r\n\r\nThe 4D Sound System was designed and developed in Amsterdam by Paul Oomen, Salvador Breed, Luc Van Weelden and Poul Holleman. It comprises 16 columns with omnidirectional speakers at several heights in each column, and the columns spaced around the room in a 12 x 12 x 4m array.\r\n\r\nThey have designed Max for Live devices which provide a range of spatial controls within Ableton Live, as well as an accompanying visual 3D model of the space and sounds within it. This allows for a spatial composition/production process, whereby each piece of music is designed as a physical entity to exist within the space, as something that can be walked around inside and explored by the listeners.\r\n\r\nThe system is called \"4D Sound\" because it produces sound in all 3 spatial dimensions, as well as being able to move sounds through the space in time - the 4th dimension.\r\n\r\nMore mixes and info:  www.maxcooper.net\r\nPhoto by Henri Blommers",

        "description": "Available from: http://www.beatport.com/release/impacts/1228072\r\n\r\nSo, it's my next album single, and this time it's a bit crunching. There is a reason for this abomination lacking softness or melody though - the album is called \"Human\", and it's my attempt to translate some common themes about the human condition, into musical form. And of course not everything about being human is beautiful or pleasant - we experience all sorts of things, and this one is about the impacts of life, in the form of pounding mechanical collisions. It's a club track really, and if you've seen me in recent months you've probably had your face smashed by it a little - sorry about that!\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Pitchfork for featuring this along with the amazing acid-style excursion from Gabe Gurnsey of Factor Floor.....AND....watch out for the Perc mix coming very soon, which takes the track to whole new labels of abrasion.\r\n\r\nHere is the press spiel in case more info and fafferage is needed -\r\n\r\nAn album that sets out to examine sonic extremes, Max Cooper's debut Human juxtaposes a whole range of electronic styles: lush orchestration fighting savage distortion, and clinical digital sound anchored by warm analogue grooves. And nowhere is that restless curiosity to experiment as apparent as the contrast of the first and second singles - first, the delicate and downtempo Adrift, versus this second release, Impacts, the roughest, toughest sampler workout Cooper has produced.\r\nOn the album, they're sequenced in a focused line to be the centre of the album's first act and then its midpoint, before the album's more experimental final act. But as a single on its own? Impacts is a stop-start stomper that has had festival crowds asking WTF!?!? for months now, and the album's only purely dancefloor moment - as far from voguish k-house sounds as it is.\r\n\r\nBut despite the harsh uncompromising sonic contrast - and this is a track that grunts into focus like a sledgehammer picking a fight with a gang of hi-hats - Impacts is, to Cooper's mind, actually something very optimistic. It's the sound of a person beaten again and again by life, but each time bouncing back and wanting more.\r\n\r\nFor the remixes, Cooper has gone for two artists with their own take on high-contrast sonics. Gabe Gurnsey of Factory Floor has folded his band's hypnotic acid tweaking into the original's rasping beats, and Perc has gone balls out with an take-it-or-leave it experimental sub-lead mix for the serious heads and big systems.\r\n\r\n 11 comments",

        "description": "Available from: http://www.beatport.com/release/impacts/1228072\r\n\r\nAnd now the Perc remix. Highly original and totally uncompromising - Perc has pulled out something heavy for his mix. No doubt this isn't something you'll all be into, but for me it's a breath of fresh air to hear something so different, hats off to Perc for pushing the boundaries.\r\n\r\nAnd it sounds insane on a big system, I'd recommend headphone listening to catch the low action....puts a smile on my face (and scared looks on many others)....\r\n\r\nps Don't bother listening if you're looking for something pleasant or comprehensible for your ears today!\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for this abomination lacking softness or melody though - the album is called \"Human\", and it's my attempt to translate some common themes about the human condition, into musical form. And of course not everything about being human is beautiful or pleasant - we experience all sorts of things, and this one is about the impacts of life, in the form of pounding mechanical collisions. It's a club track really, and if you've seen me in recent months you've probably had your face smashed by it a little - sorry about that!\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the Quietus for featuring this Perc remix, which takes the track to whole new labels of abrasion.\r\n\r\nHere is the full press info in case needed -\r\n\r\nAn album that sets out to examine sonic extremes, Max Cooper's debut Human juxtaposes a whole range of electronic styles: lush orchestration fighting savage distortion, and clinical digital sound anchored by warm analogue grooves. And nowhere is that restless curiosity to experiment as apparent as the contrast of the first and second singles - first, the delicate and downtempo Adrift, versus this second release, Impacts, the roughest, toughest sampler workout Cooper has produced.\r\n\r\nOn the album, they're sequenced in a focused line to be the centre of the album's first act and then its midpoint, before the album's more experimental final act. But as a single on its own? Impacts is a stop-start stomper that has had festival crowds asking WTF!?!? for months now, and the album's only purely dancefloor moment - as far from voguish k-house sounds as it is.\r\n\r\nBut despite the harsh uncompromising sonic contrast - and this is a track that grunts into focus like a sledgehammer picking a fight with a gang of hi-hats - Impacts is, to Cooper's mind, actually something very optimistic. It's the sound of a person beaten again and again by life, but each time bouncing back and wanting more.\r\n\r\nFor the remixes, Cooper has gone for two artists with their own take on high-contrast sonics. Gabe Gurnsey of Factory Floor has folded his band's hypnotic acid tweaking into the original's rasping beats, and Perc has gone balls out with an take-it-or-leave it experimental sub-lead mix for the serious heads and big systems.",

This is the first single from it, Adrift, with my long running vocal collaborator Kathrin deBoer. I had a simple piano chord progression and a randomised percussion idea to give to Kathrin, who captured the feeling beautifully with her lyrics and jazz influenced vocal approach. It's more of a personal piece of music for me than a club track, which is the approach I've taken for the whole album. \r\n \r\nMore previews, a couple more singles (and some really amazing remixers!) to follow between now and March.\r\n \r\nAdrift is out now - itunes www.smarturl.it/adrift\r\nbeatport - http://www.beatport.com/release/adrift/1201254",

        "description": "This track started as a beautiful short piano solo from Tom Hodge. I wanted to keep the focus firmly on the piano and just introduce some subtle electronic elements, while looping Tom's short sections to give a full arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe percussive clicks came from a visit to Manchester when I played at WHP. The day after a friend was kind enough to offer us free tickets to see Manchester United play Fulham in the FA cup, so I brought my binaural mics along to capture the sound of the huge crowd. I'm not quite ready to introduce huge crowd cheering noises into my tracks (maybe the EDM career can begin next year), but I found that even when the sound of the crowd was cut down to little fragments using Monolake's Granulator, they still had a nice quality. So the percussion on this track are made from the sound of Old Trafford, and there are some points in the track (right at the end for example) where I open the release a little and you can here some crowd coming through.\r\n\r\nYou can buy the full release on iTunes at http://www.smarturl.it/FragmentedTwo",

        "description": "This track is about emergence from the combination of polar opposites. Fragments of self from very different places, but part of the same whole.\r\n\r\nCombining classical and computational elements is something I've been experimenting with for some years, but this attempt to combine the extreme opposites of each was spurred on by some chance DJing experiments, a fortuitous collaboration opportunity, and the amazing work of my friends Olafur Arnalds and Vaetxh (Rob Clouth). I found that I could mix the most beautiful and delicate piano solo of Olafur, with the most hyper-edited and jarring glitch of Vaetxh, and that the result actually worked, well, for me anyway, even if half the people in the club stood confused about how to dance. So when the opportunity arose to work with the pianist and composer Tom Hodge, I wanted to try and create this form of merger of extremes for a release, rather than it being confined to my DJ toolbox (also on the classical meets glitch history from a slightly different angle, check out \"Rossz Csillag Alatt SzÃ¼letett\" from Venetian Snares 2005!).\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion of ideas and approach with Tom, he sat and played and made some recordings for me, which I then chopped and build chords and structure around, sent them back to him to play over the top of again, and then back to me to edit and glitch the playing along with the nasty noises. My detailing process was that of finding some interesting sound sources (binaural recordings, drum hit samples, clangs and slams etc) and using some Max for live randomisation chains to generate lots of partially random complexity which I could then edit as audio before repeating the process with additional layers, eventually bringing the recorded piano audio in to the editing too.\r\n\r\nAt completion of the audio I was really happy to find out that Nick Cobby, one of my favourite video artists and long standing collaborator, was available and interested in working on the visual side of the project. He took the combination of seemingly incompatible opposites, and applied it visually with his beautiful generative forms, smooth and organic for the melodic sections, and jagged and abrasive for the percussive sections - big thanks to Nick for his amazing work as always!\r\n\r\nSo, that's probably enough ranting about this track from me, aside from why it is like it is, I hope it's something that you can enjoy irrespective of the conceptual faff.",

Sometimes its interesting to take a track in a completely new direction but in the case of Max and Tom's collaboration I was immediately drawn to the subtle harmonic undercurrent of the synth lines beneath the main piano parts and figured it would be interesting to put together an arrangement that brought that to the fore. \r\n\r\nI started with a rough layering and overlay of the piano samples - trying to re-arrange them into different combinations than in the original to create something that had the same feel (on a side note, its always pleasing to work with recordings like this of instruments that sound played - i.e., you can hear the movement of the pedals and the fingers on the keys rather than a surgically-extracted sequence of notes) but that came to the main melodies from a different angle.  I can't really compete with Max's glitchy rhythmic production and since this is so distinctive it seemed like a bit of a cop-out to make too much use of these samples in any case so in the end the main part of what I used of the rhythm was a short kick drum sample that I processed in various ways to create the studded melodic cross-rhythm that I used for most of the middle of the track.\r\n\r\nWith the bare bones in place the majority of the rest of the work came from layering up the arrangement with the kinds of synths and strings that I make use of in my Petrels stuff.  Like I said, I was drawn to the low root synth line in the original that casts a subtle melodic shade over the piano lines so using this as a starting point I slowly built up the orchestration around it so as to make it much more of a focal point.  In the end, hopefully the result is something akin to a huge group of assorted musicians attempting a spontaneous live version of what essentially started as a duet performance. Well that was the idea anyhow.",

The result is the new Fragmented Self EP, which is out now on Fields.\r\n\r\nWe explored a few different possibilities ranging from the attempt to fuse extreme opposites in the title track Fragments of Self, to the distorted mayhem of falling off a cliff, and Quantet, where I chopped Tomâ€™s orchestral session into tiny pieces and built something unnatural.\r\n\r\nThe EP comes with a remix from one of my favourite artists at the moment â€“ Petrels, if you donâ€™t know his stuff already I highly recommend a listen. Heâ€™s done an amazing job on the remix of Fragments of Self, stripping away those nasty glitches and getting down to the nice stuff in a really live organic sort of way.\r\n\r\nThe EP comes in two parts, with the second part coming in a few weeks, AND, a music video from Nick Cobby for Fragements of Self, which is pretty stupendous (that good!). I hope you like some of this new work.",

        "description": "This track started with some interesting strings recordings Tom made, where he arranged the instruments in terms of their frequency range, from the lowest in the centre to the highest on the edges. He provided my with a few unused recordings of this session and I sort of brutalised them, in as much as the end result sounds nothing at all like the original recordings. I just liked the timbre and texture that occurred when I cut them up, with each hit being a complex mixture of chords, one bleeding into the other so that a lot of the samples are quite impure melodically.\r\n\r\nIt just turned into an experiment of what I could do with these odd melodic units, or quanta of the original tentet, hence the name - Quantet. In the end I went for a very simple stripped back approach, nothing too unexpected or complex in this one, but hopefully a nice mood, that was the aim anyway.",

        "description": "This track is about having a walk on a nice sunny day in the countryside, all is well and good, until you accidentally fall off a cliff. We chose the title in Deutsch due to the kick focused poundingness rhythmically.\r\n\r\nIt was a fun track as I decided I'd let loose, and you might notice, particularly towards the end it gets pretty loose! But luckily Tom's beautiful 5 bar piano riff is there to anchor things at either end, and hopefully save you from the death by cliff (you might notice it's a pain to mix with those 5 bar loops though).\r\n\r\nSo a bit of background - Tom Hodge is a great pianist and composer who I met recently, and we've been working on lots of interesting things. This is the most extreme in terms of the noise levels really, we've done some nice stuff too, as we're not planning on starting a death metal band just yet.\r\n\r\nLot's more to hear from this collaboration with the release out on Monday 28th on Fields + an amazing remix from Petrels of the A-side track (Fragments of Self) + an amazing video for the A-side by Nick Cobby, which we're all really excited about!\r\n\r\nThanks for listening!",

        "description": "As you probably already know from my constant rantings, Nils Frahm is one of my favourite artists, and no doubt the best live performer I've seen. I had the opportunity to remix his Juno EP, so I had a play with both tracks to see which one might work out best. The thing was though, both were amongst the most enjoyable remix projects I've ever worked on, because the original instrumentals on Nils' Juno were so rich and beautiful, and seemingly well suited to what I wanted to do with them. So in the end I remixed both tracks from the EP, resulting in the relaxed and easy to digest club format remix of \"For\", and the slightly more obscure, glitched and detailed remix of \"Peter\", with the two hopefully working as a pair as does the original Juno EP.\r\n\r\nAnd now, courtesy of Erased Tapes, Decibel Festival, Dummy Magazine and XLR8R, and me too, you can have both remixes for absolute total free to download and share and post as you like - just hit the download button on the soundcloud player or page, with no need to visit a Russian mp3 store!\r\n\r\nThe original features on XLR8R and Dummy are here, thanks to both for featuring >>\r\nhttp://www.xlr8r.com/news/2013/10/download-max-coopers-new-remix-n\r\nhttp://www.dummymag.com/new-music/premiere-nils-frahm-peter-max-cooper-remix\r\n\r\nAnd finally thank you for listening to my stuff over the years and supporting what I've been doing, I hope you like this freebie, it's probably the best thing I've worked on....strictly rubbish music to come from here on!\r\n\r\nps Nils is playing at village underground in London on th 18th October with Olafur and Rival Consoles - will be great no doubt, hopefully catch you there.",

But aside from all that, this was just a really enjoyable remix to work on because the original is such a great piece of music, and seemingly so well suited to what I wanted to do with it - which was to try and turn Nils' instrumental jam on his Juno, into something house/techno/club/44 compatible, but still carrying the class and feeling of the original. It was one of those remixes that just seemed to fit and flow easily, with minimum strain and maximum enjoyment on my part - usually a good sign for a remix (the one's that have to be forced never seem to quite get there).\r\n\r\nNot only is this one of the best remix projects I've been lucky enough to be involved with, it's also available totally free for you to download and share as you like, courtesy of Erased Tapes and Decibel festival where myself and Nils played last weekend, as well as XLR8R, who were good enough to first feature the 'For' remix.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it's also a thank you to YOU for listening an supporting my work over the years....thank you and I hope you like the track!....\r\n\r\nps if you're in London on the 18th, Nils is playing an Erased Tapes showcase at Village Underground.'\r\n\r\n'Frahm's beautiful, clever piano melodies are a perfect match for Cooper's emotional, distinctive breed of production, blurring lines between the recital hall and the dance floor.' â€“ Earmilk",

        "description": "Le Carousel is Phil Kieran's latest LP, which is great, it was a pleasure to work with this track, and all the better because I decided I was going to do something weird with it! The lovely pads and vocals provided the backbone for my remix, and I just tried to accentuate these with a long ambient build.\r\n\r\nThe track would probably work better just with this ambient part and no more, but I decided to add on some sort of odd drop at the end, where it goes all hectic with lots of double timed randomised beats. To continue with the unexpected theme I went for another extended build to total distortion, climaxing in nothingness!\r\n\r\nIt's probably not the easiest track to fit into a set unless you just use the ambient part, but it's always nice to just let go and mess around with a track without worrying about how it might function outside of what you feel you want to do musically at the time.\r\n\r\nRelease date is 23rd September on PKR",

If you want the full length (mixable) version then you can get that from here as part of an excellent free remix package: http://mmothsmusic.com/diariesremixes\r\n\r\nIt was a nice remix to work on, with some great field recordings, a lovely simple piano riff, and some looped vocal samples which all slotted nicely into the new structure I wanted to go with - something a bit more club compatible than the original, but still hopefully carrying the feeling.\r\n\r\nI messed around with the field recordings in the Monolake Granulator a bit, to get some subtle glitch/randomness in there, but other than that I went pretty straight on the arrangement, just gradually introducing the layers and adding a new synth to punctuate the peak, and a new bassline and chord variation.\r\n\r\nThe idea with the field recording/glitched intro section was to try and make something non-melodic and a bit harsh and cold, in attempted polar contrast to the warmth of the main melodic section and enveloping bass ie I wanted try and make the bleak part emphasise and accentuate the nice part.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, here it is, as a free download for all.",

        "description": "The Slow Revolt is a great musician, with a great voice, so it was a pleasure to remix this track of his. I tried to enhance the vibe of the original rather than force it into any sort of club format. I just added some new chords by granularising the guitar and layering it up, and focused on making some interesting effects with the vocals and my usual weird noises before finally introducing new bass and strings later to try and bring everything to a peak. I hope you like it!\r\n\r\nAvailable from:\r\nBoomkat http://bit.ly/10OaO6X\r\niTunes http://bit.ly/17tGtND\r\nJuno http://bit.ly/16etHmB\r\nBeatport: http://www.beatport.com/release/doldrums/1093992",

        "description": "Here is my second EP in the conditions series. For this one I worked with a great vocalist called Kathrin DeBoer, who you may know from a band called Belleruche. She has a really interesting voice, not the usual for electronic music. We just had a bit of a live jam and this is what came out, it's pretty rough around the edges, with the live improvised vocals straight in there on the finished track. I just liked the raw feeling that she caught from the sketches I had and the idea behind them, so we went with it as it happened, I hope you like it!",

        "description": "This is the second idea I worked on with Kathrin deBoer for the Conditions Two EP, and an attempt to make something surreal. I tried to use her voice as an instrument in the track, rather than presenting it as a normal vocal at the forefront of the mix. I used lots of Max for Live fiddlingâ€™s to mangle up her vocals into all sorts of weird noises, and then picked out some of my favourites to use in the track. Most of the noises that arenâ€™t the drums and main synths, so pretty much all the weird noises in the track, are made from Kathrinâ€™s voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall feeling was something soft and organic, where in addition to the unpredictability and non-loopy manner of the vocal effects, the drums also follow a loose and slightly randomised pattern, with lots of shuffle to add to the free feeling. I thought the approach made it end up sounding a bit maddening and messy, and there was also a strong feeling of space in there with the main pads, so this combined with the surrealist approach lead me to the name â€˜Falling Into Recursive Spaceâ€™.\r\n\r\nFor Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nsoundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nwww.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nwww.maxcooper.net/",

When I was doing my Post-Doc at UCL I used to go the British Museum to relax, and work in the beautiful library there, so I chose the space for the mix. I wanted to capture the ambient atmosphere in the central courtyard, so I did some binaural recording to include in the mix. I also wanted to make the mix something of an exploration through history and ideas in line with the contents of the museum, so I brought in lots of disparate music spanning the centuries and continents. I also mixed it in a way to be like a journey though the museum, turning corners and regularly coming across something totally different and unexpected, with each track being like a different exhibit. Hence the name of the mix, in that, each piece of music almost has a visual content.\r\n\r\nFor the full track list + more information see the feature:\r\nhttp://www.magneticmag.com/2013/04/sounds-spaces-001-max-cooper-the-british-museum/\r\n\r\nFor more Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nhttp://maxcooper.net/",

        "description": "So, here is my latest experiment on Traum Schallplatten!\r\n\r\nThis EP is themed with movements through different mediums, and for two of the tracks I worked with Nicolas Bougaieff, one of the founders of Liine (who make Lemur, Griid, Remiix and other great music apps).\r\n\r\nFracture is about moving though fractured space. Meadows is about moving through some nice warm summer fields. Ellipse is about moving though ellipses, and Walls is about moving through walls of sound.\r\n\r\nSo there you go, I hope there's something in there you like - there's also great remixes from Microtrauma, Logiztik Sounds and Nyma, plus an amazing video, finally, with the return of Whiskas FX (Andrew Brewer) which will be released any day soon!\r\n\r\nOut now digital + vinyl",

        "description": "Continuing with the theme of the Movements EP, this one is about movement through fractured space. We used Nick's great operator patch again (the same one as for Ellipse), and Nick came up with this nice riff. I mainly just made lots of strange noises and worked on the drums, automation, arrangement, details and overall feel, trying to keep it pretty simple and too the point - that is a nice flowing club style with plenty of broken reality moments.\r\n\r\nThis one has a really straight groove, with all the drums quite quantised to a linear grid, while Ellipse uses some of the same elements with a heavy shuffled groove - you can hear the really different club feel that results in the two tracks.\r\n",

So I've put a really simple beat structure on there with a maddeningly repetitive two note acid style riff to try and lull people into some sort of brain dead state before they hit the wall, and exit out the other side wondering what just happened. That's the idea anyway, a track of maximised contrasts, it works great in a club, maybe not so much of home listener, see what you think anyway!",

The concept I had in mind this time was a summer meadow, with lots of warmth and activity and detail of all natural processes going on, and a feeling of movement though the space. I have no idea how well that idea of mine translates into the piece of music for you, but hopefully it works in some way (your interpretation is more important than my concept really).\r\n\r\nAndrew Brewer (Whiskas FX) has made a video for this one with some abstracted meadows combined with moire patterns, it's a beauty!....can't wait to get that out in the next few days.\r\n\r\n(This is just a clip of the track btw, if you want the full length version it will be out 1st April!)",

        "description": "I went pretty minimal on this one, no hi-hats, and pretty much no drums actually, just a kick and much later into the track a snare comes in.....There was something about the simple repetitive 2 note melody hits and chords I landed on that just seemed to work without needing anything much else, well hopefully it works for other people too and not just me. It's been going down really well in the clubs at least, it seems to make people clap for some reason, maybe because it's so simple and kick focused rhythmically, it's got a bit of a marching stomp feel.\r\n\r\nI stripped out most of the parts from the original, and focused on the great pads and vocal sweeps, which seemed to lead to the melodic idea somehow. It was one of those remixes which flowed nice and easily, not too much conscious thought required, I just let it flow out.\r\n\r\nI made an edit of an old video to fit the track too, full details about that on the youtube link:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/pXdoDtQlvDE",

        "description": "I had a lot of fun working on this remix, mainly because Marc and Ken provided some great parts to work with. I messed around with chopping up the main riff so that it plays different versions out of each channel to give an interesting left/right effect, every so often hitting the same pattern on both channels and suddenly jumping to the middle as a result. Then it disintegrates and recombines in new form during the break before finally reaching the original riff on the main drop....I've been playing it out a lot, seems to do the job nicely in the clubs....all about the bassline as often is the way with my stuff!",

So when the chance came along to remix something, I chose his track Burn, which I love, and tried to put my own interpretation on it. The original was already so close to perfection melodically, that I found I couldn't do a lot to improve it. So instead I focused on trying to enhance what was already there, using contrasting sections of soundscapes and detailed sparse beats, and adding builds of saturation to exaggerate each melodic element. I found it was a really nice remix to work on, I hope you like it!",

It started as a techno track but I realised it worked best without drums to get down to what it's really all about. It was released on Traum a while ago, but I just stumbled across it today and it seemed to suit my mood so I thought I better put it on soundcloud.\r\n\r\nThe artwork is a scan of a dried flower by my friend Ben Slater (http://www.behance.net/benslater), which I adjusted the colours on to make all saturated and purple. It's from the same set of scans that Ben used to make my Expressions EP artwork - still my favourite release artwork to date for sure.",

        "description": "The concept for this one is about our nature as deterministic biological machines, unable to escape from our natural responses and behaviour finely tuned by millions of years of evolution, and now quite out of sync with the modern world we live in. The lyrics \"I can't stop it\" were the starting point for the concept, and I attempted to create a robotic-like sequences from chopped BRAIDS vocals to further present the idea.\r\n\r\nTwo more points to note, this one comes with an amazing remix from Ghosting Season, which I recommend you check out straight away!

        "description": "BRAIDS are one of my favourite bands, so when I had the chance to work with them I jumped on it. The vocals were the starting point, which I layered and used to generate a general feeling also in fitting with the lyrics, which then defined how I built the rest of the tracks around them. The first one from the EP is \"Pleasures\", for which I wanted to make something positive and warming, with nice straightforward drums and nothing too harsh in terms of builds and drops, just a delicate flow to give a pleasurable listening experience, hopefully!",

        "description": "Rob Clouth is one of my favourite producers out there at the moment, if you've heard any of my sets recently then you will have heard his Vaetxh stuff in there, the glitchy super-detailed madness! So when he turned himself to making an EP for Traum I jumped on the opportunity to get involved with a remix.\r\n\r\nHis methods and style are very original, so it was quite a difficult remix to make, the track just didn't want to fit into a normal techno format! I ended up going for a really heavy shuffle on the drums and trying to make the track a little more dancefloor in it's arrangement, but I wanted to try and keep the approach of the original too so I introduced a lot of complexity into the drums, as Rob said, it's like a lattice of details. So here it is, I hope you like it, and if you're going to do one thing this year, then give the rest of the EP a good listen, in my opinion it's the best release of the year in this genre, properly amazing stuff from Rob Clouth.",

        "description": "This original track had a really nice piano riff along with an interesting groove and some weird noises, perfect remix material! Also I love what Mauro Norti has been doing, and Wide Angle, so I got involved. I think I did a lot of the ideas for this one during a wait for a delayed flight in an airport, and I was feeling pretty tired at the time, and a bit paranoid because some weird guy sitting opposite seemed to be staring at me. Then some other guy came up to me with a mobile phone in two pieces, slightly freakily shouting words of English that made no sense and trying to give me this phone, I never managed to figure out what he was on about. Anyway, this track was my escapism from all that crap, I tried to make something nice and relaxing and enveloping to remove me from reality a little, hope you like it.",

The problem was I couldn't decide which one to remix, so I decided to remix both tracks into one. This is the result, containing parts from two different tracks, combined into a single remix.

So I picked out a selection of my favourite tracks before leaving, and was constrained to use only these. The difficulty was that I had chosen a load of different genres, so it turned into a puzzle of how to fit them all together into some sort of coherent flow. It was a good way to work in the end as it encouraged me to make edits of lots of the tracks, and also lead to some nice unexpected combinations.\r\n\r\n[Note from Max HQ:  the original of Max feat BRAIDS - Automaton - track 6 can be heard on Max's app:  http://bit.ly/QHzLL5]\r\n\r\nFor more Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nsoundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nwww.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nhttp://maxcooper.net/",

I then added some melodic hits in several layers each of different loop lengths, which go up or down in syncopating rhythms, sounding to me like they spiral in and out of one another, with tight spiral points and longer curves, hence the name and artwork!",

A gravity well is an area of space that is warped by a large mass, looking something like a well in 2D representations hence the the name, and an area of space where you would feel the inescapable heavy pull of gravity all over your body, which was the feeling I was trying to produce with the track - For the mass I was thinking something a bit heavier than the earth, but not so heavy as to be painful. This one has a video on the way too, following the same concept, that should be ready this week!",

        "description": "This track is a reference back to old days when me and Jeet used to be residents at the Firefly club night in Nottingham. We used to do this 6 deck show with all sorts of turntablism and on-the-fly bootlegs and stuff like that, back when people still were interested in what you could do with some turntables and mixers. Jeet had this particular bootleg idea layering up some snare driven tracks, which we then recorded and glitched up - it was a monster!....so,  years later we realised that we should try and create an original track in that format, and this is the result - something of a reminder of Xircus/Thrash Jelly, and the mayhem of the closing set at the Garvey. And also a sound which is hopefully relevant now with the kick-focused groove, and in fitting with my other work via the glitch aspect. It was a lot of fun to work on, and is no doubt the hardest track I've ever made, if you're into my deep melodic stuff then I suggest you don't listen as you might be offended!\n\nRelease date is 280612 on Stephan Bodzin's Herzblut label, with the Bside track \"Ruptured\". My manager was a bit concerned I might offend people with the EP tracks \"Fisted\" and \"Ruptured\", but I think the music itself is a bit offensive too so the titles will hopefully be fitting at least. I wanted to call the whole package \"Thrust\" EP, haha, but that was deemed going too far, so we settled on \"Mechanical Concussion\" EP, to focus a little more on the industrial aspect. So there you go, turn it up as loud as you can bare and see what side you come down on!",
