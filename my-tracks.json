Alex started off with the main bulk of the ideas for the track, and I initially chopped it all back to a couple of key elements.   I then experimented with some FFT effects and building some chaotic randomising manipulations of the basic elements, and sliding drum rhythms so that one drum element would slip relative to another and then back in - all an attempt to generate some movement and variation from the simple building blocks.\"\n\nAlex:   \"It was interesting to hear the rough ideas I had created, developed in a totally different way to how they would have had I been writing the track by myself. Inspired by the new direction the track was going in - \"\n\nMax:  \"I'd made a mess.  Alex helped tidy it all up and bring it enough back into line to work as a dancefloor track\"\n\nAlex:  \"- I layered some more percussion hits and string textures.  We continued the process of sending stems back and forth, refining each others ideas as well and creating new ones until the track was ready.\"\n\nMax:  \"The quotient series has been a nice opportunity to experiment with new music outside of the restrictions of record labels and their need to sell product.  This freedom has left me open to put out a piano solo and feedback matrix, a 10 minute ambient to drum and bass glitch remix, a track scored to a video, a one off club collab and more - all projects that I wanted to try, and am glad I did, but that wouldn't easily fit into the usual EP/LP formats. \n\nIt's been a sort of sketch and experiment project, much of it tied to the Emergence visual shows, where I've been experimenting with how I can perform music and visual in sync in a live format. \"\n","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225204106","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/eve-with-alex-banks-quotient-66","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000130457859-bd70yu-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/nsh26RGlcYtR_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225204106/stream","playback_count":30656,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1031,"comment_count":30,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225204106/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":211610914,"created_at":"2015/06/23 13:13:33 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":272533,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":11627228,"last_modified":"2015/10/04 22:49:06 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"ambient electronica piano teotihuacan \"max cooper\" \"tom hodge\" fields post classical","permalink":"teotihuacan-part-2-with-tom-hodge","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://btprt.dj/1DHZhHk","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Strings","title":"Teotihuacan (Part 2) with Tom Hodge","description":"This track started with a visit to the pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico. A beautiful place, but a place where a lot of the original culture and knowledge that created the pyramids has been lost, and replaced with a rebuilt, tourist trap.\n\nSo it's a mix of loss and sadness and beauty with an edge of modern misuse, which I tried to capture in the original strings from which the track was built. I also made some binaural recordings of the sounds there, and a storm which came in, to give a real layer of atmosphere from the actual location. Tom Hodge then played piano to these elements, bringing the whole piece to life.\n\nI loved the piano on it's own in addition to the strings version, so as well as the Part 2 on the EP, we also created a Part 1 piano solo version with the piano sent into a feedback matrix with lots of randomising to create unusual textures.

The two hour format really allows some time to explore ideas musically as well.\n\nSo bringing everything together, I decided to try and make it an exploration of everything that has made me so obsessed with electronic music for the last 20 years, with some of my favourite records from the mid 90's, unreleased material from my favourite artists like Nils Frahm, Lusine, Tim Hecker and Rob Clouth, and a range of genres from ambient to 90 bpm electronica, house and techno, all the way up to 170bpm glitched jungle mayhem - I thought, why not have some fun with it!?\n\nSo it's certainly not a normal club mix, it's just what I think is the best music out there, without worrying about what genre or box any particular track fits into or how things should be done \"properly\". I wanted to leave some sections quite ambient as well, to give breathing space between the peaks, so I'm happy to be able to post this new version up, minus the broadcast talking and idents.\n\nThe mix also contains some new work from me, some unreleased, and two tracks from my new EP with Tom Hodge, one of which you can download for free from here www.maxcooper.net, the other you can download from iTunes - http://hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP - or Beatport - http://btprt.dj/1DHZhHk\n\nTrack List\n\n1.

It's a beautiful place, but when I asked about its history I was told that most of the knowledge and culture of the people who built it was lost, with the arrival of the Europeans. Now it's turned into a rebuilt money making tourist trap, with the loss of its real meaning.\n\nI recorded the space and sounds there with binaural mics, so I could try and capture some of the feeling of it, including a storm which came in, and then I wrote a strings part inspired by the feelings of the visit there. Tom Hodge brought the piece to life by playing a piano part in addition, and I loved the piano so much I decided to make two parts, the first with the piano only, combined with the binaural recordings and a randomising delay feedback network, and the second part with the strings. The first part of Teotihuacan is available exclusively from the free download Quotient Series, and the second part will be coming on the Artefact EP in April.\n\npreorder available - www.smarturl.it/ArtefactEP‏","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/teotihuacan-part-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000107281329-px5af0-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ne6fXNxEU3D5_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/stream","playback_count":98522,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1264,"comment_count":45,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":183323313,"created_at":"2014/12/27 11:06:26 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":626212,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":26896966,"last_modified":"2015/10/29 23:57:52 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"rustle of the stars\" \"max cooper\" remix rmx \"drum and bass\" electronica post classical modern distortion Epic","permalink":"the-rustle-of-the-stars-sleeping-land-max-cooper-rmx-quotient-36","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DOWNLOAD HERE","genre":"quotient series","title":"The Rustle Of The Stars - Sleeping Land - Max Cooper Rmx - Quotient 3/6","description":"FREE DOWNLOAD HERE: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n \nYour December free download is a remix, and an important piece of music to me personally. Partly because it was the result of a chance string of events driven by my love of the original track and a fortuitous meeting with Frederic D. Oberland, one half of The Rustle of the Stars with Richard Knox. And partly because I love the intensity and feeling of the original which I have tried to convey in my own way with little regard for the usual rules of making music - ambient strings arrangement at one end, and a drum and bass wall of sound at the other, because that's what I felt was required to communicate the emotions I found in the original piece, inspired by \"a musical passage through the North Pole explorer diaries\".  \n \nHere's what Richard and Frederic said about the original:  \"We would like to think of this as a polar journey to the ends of the earth through the arctic sea. We kept in mind the first polar expeditions, Edgar Allan Poe's Dream-Land, the ships trapped or crushed by ice, the point of no-return, the minds sinking, the attempt on the Pole ending in disaster, the quest of the Northwest Passage, Erebus & Terror, the Mercy Bay, Mangazeya, Charles Francis Hall, Beechey Island, the Midnight sun and the Polar night.\"\n \nIt's very winter-y. And I'm very pleased Richard and Frederic agreed to allow me to give the remix away for free to anyone who would like to hear it this Christmas!\n\nThe Rustle of the Stars - Sleeping Land (Part 1) - Max Cooper Remix\n\nYou can find the beautiful full album from the Rustle of the Stars, here: http://www.therustleofthestars.com/ ","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/the-rustle-of-the-stars-sleeping-land-max-cooper-rmx-quotient-36","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000101468575-3r6wls-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/k8vOyLASe30o_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313/stream","playback_count":59111,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1510,"comment_count":86,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":178585246,"created_at":"2014/11/25 15:27:08 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":4412990,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":178286909,"last_modified":"2015/09/28 13:54:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Semiosis \"Max Cooper\" Dj Set Quotient Series number 2 of 6","permalink":"semiosis-dj-set-quotient-26","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DL FROM HERE","genre":"Ratio","title":"Semiosis - DJ Set - Free DL - Quotient 2/6","description":"I’ve been pretty obsessed with simple ratios in the forms of chord progressions for as long as I can remember, hence all the long sustained chords in my music - for some reason I find chords even more satisfying in the lower frequencies, maybe we can pick out the ratios more clearly when they’re using slower wave fronts like with bass. I also love melodies and rhythms that combine different loop lengths so that interesting syncopation effects arise as a result of the ratios between the loop lengths. A lot of my favourite new tracks recently have used these types of techniques, so I decided to base a mix around them - Semiosis.\n\nSemiosis is a process by which we create meaning from comparison. If I tell you a made up word that doesn’t relate to anything you know, you can get little meaning from it - meaning comes from what something isn’t, how it relates to other things you know. Music works in exactly this way, with us comparing meaningless wave frequencies to find feeling in how one value relates to another - a ratio.\n\nWhether or not you like it, your subconscious mind is a massive maths geek, and it gets really excited when it finds a 1:3:5 ratio in the stream of air pressure information being received by your ears.  Ratio has the capacity to make us feel and make us dance. But it all happens without us being aware of it. \n\nWhen you listen to long drawn out chords and syncopating rhythms however, you can’t really get the full feeling from just a quick dip in, I find that it needs time for the ratios to wash over and sink in. The more time you give to it the more beauty you can find hidden in there. So the mix is very much of this long form, it doesn’t jump from one extreme to another like some of my other mixes, and needs to have some time to develop.\n\nThis is part 2 of 6 from the Quotient Series, all of which can be downloaded for free in return for signing up to my new download website, built specifically for bringing you new original tracks, remixes and mixes, which you won't be able to get from anywhere else. \n\nYou can find the website here: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nMax Cooper - Semiosis - DJ Set - Quotient 2/6\n\n1.

After the release a builder of sansula instruments in the Netherlands was kind enough to give me one as a present in case I wanted to use one again in a live recording, which I have finally got around to doing now with this track!\n\nMy process consisted of me sitting in my studio (badly) playing the thumb plucked sansula for quite a while, so that I could go back to the recording and pull out some useable loops as a starting point. I wanted a nice warm analogue chord progression to complement, but more in the high bass and low mids than my usual chord progression that's down really low, to fill the mix with the warmth as much as possible.\n\nThe track still needed something though, so I turned to some spare recordings of my favourite vocalist - Kathrin deBoer, from some of our previous recording sessions. I didn't want to go for the usual full lyrical approach of a vocal collab track, I just wanted to add some small snippets of human feeling to round off the track properly.\n\nThe release is coming out on Fields on the 1st of December along with an intense synth experiment with a Prophet 08, and beautiful remixes from David August and Throwing Snow.\n\nIf you're not into buying music there is also a new website I have just launched which will be providing exclusive new free downloads for all in return for signing up to the website - http://www.maxcooper.net/downloads","label_name":"FIELDS","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2014,"release_month":12,"release_day":1,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/origins-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000098158007-s9wn0w-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/eba72QyTBdGt_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262/stream","playback_count":360699,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":7382,"comment_count":203,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":176428370,"created_at":"2014/11/11 18:32:15 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":459770,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":20178068,"last_modified":"2015/10/29 23:57:51 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Melodic house techno arc \"max cooper\" prophet moog filter dsi Chill 44 quotient series part 1","permalink":"arc-free-download-quotient-series-16","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"MAX COOPER FREE DWNLDS","genre":"analogue","title":"Arc - Free Download - Quotient 1/6","description":"Hello, I’m launching a new site dedicated to provide you with new music that you won’t be able to find anywhere else.

They were having a lot of fun during the recordings and I think it comes through.\n\nThe fun we were having making the recordings was aided by the fact that Gearbox records (who are releasing the EP 6th Oct on vinyl, and 3rd Nov on digital) had provided Mark Ronson's recording studio for us to work in, so it was a pleasure all round.\n\nThere are 3 more tracks to come from the release, 2 ambient, and one absolute abomination where I wanted to see what would happen if I made the most f*&ked up track I could and then asked them to improvise over it - more clips and info coming soon.\n\nIf you want to catch Quentin Collins playing, he does regular gigs in London at Ronnie Scotts, amongst other places.

But after some new studio additions and work developing new ideas and new experiments, I’ve got enough fresh material to draw on, along with some old, to put together a new live set only composed of my originals, some remixes I’ve done, and I had to include a couple from the Inhuman remix package because there’s some great work on there from Lusine and Rodriguez Jr. among others.\r\n\r\nI’ve approached this mix a little more like my live sets of old, keeping it pretty smooth and letting the tracks do the talking, rather than going too heavy on the genre-swapping and BPM-juggling as I have been doing on other mixes recently. There’s still some (hopefully) unexpected moments though of course, a strings solo, some crunchy glitch, backwards Nyatiti, several brand new never heard before tracks, a homemade desolation bootleg of Spastik, my first ever totally analogue tracks (I’ve only recently taken the plunge into the analogue synth world), and two live Jazz improvisation sessions recorded recently in London.\r\n\r\nThe artwork embedded is made by Andre Britz, who has literally created some \"fluid landscapes\" works, of which he was kind enough to donate a custom piece for this mix - Thanks Andre! You can find him here: https://www.behance.net/Andre\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the mix is about being wrapped up in a warm exploration of feelings and landscapes. It will work best with a nice pair of headphones and an open mind. I hope there’s at least some parts in there you enjoy!\r\n\r\n1. Max Cooper - TBA1\r\n2. Collaboration - TBA2\r\n3.

I'm just going back over some of his first releases on Ghostly International from the early 00's, and it's amazing how ahead of the game he's always been. His combination of delicate productions and beautiful warm analogue melodies, intricacies and amazing shuffling grooves have been a big inspiration for me over the years, with his \"A certain distance\" album from 2009 being one of my all-time most listened too albums.\r\n\r\nSo Lusine was one of my ideal remixers for the album, and thanks to Sean at Decibel festival, the hookup was made and he was into the idea. He's turned out a beautiful remix of Woven Ancestry, which if you've seen me play recently, you probably heard in my set. The mix has special balance of being a great piece of music to listen to at home, but then when it's unleashed in a club it's groove takes on a whole new life which I hadn't seen coming until I tried it out - Thanks Jeff!\r\n\r\nMax","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/woven-ancestry-lusine-remix-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000077470267-0ehhet-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ggSZkNvcRQRz_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800/stream","playback_count":214466,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":5793,"comment_count":178,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":142212919,"created_at":"2014/03/30 18:55:20 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":368439,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":14735150,"last_modified":"2015/12/11 00:30:40 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Potency Human album fields distortion intense metal noise","permalink":"potency-clip-from-human-lp-out","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://btprt.dj/TC7WHJ","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Electronic","title":"Potency (clip) from HUMAN LP out now","description":"Taken from \"Human\" out now >\r\n\r\nDigital: iTunes www.smarturl.it/MCHuman / Beatport http://btprt.dj/TC7WHJ\r\nVinyl / CD bit.ly/FIELDSshop\r\n\r\nThis was a fun track to make. I wanted to try and make something purely noisy and intense, but always delivering a feeling that 100 times more power was still fighting to get out, like the potency of human nature. After deciding on a basic chord structure, it was just a matter of layering and layering, which gave an interesting interference result, you can hear the different waves interacting to give beating patterns.\r\n\r\nThe layers were made from some Operators in Ableton with Guitar Rigs and Saturators, plus a Moog Minitaur with a fast LFO with high resonance, plus Andy Ramsay’s overdriven guitar amps and speakers re-recorded, plus Phil Kieran’s tape saturation/distortion - it’s basically a right mess! You can even hear some of the leftovers on Phil’s tape at the end, with him speeding it up and slowing it down. Interestingly, that Moog on there was the only analogue synthesiser used in the whole album, the rest was all sourced digitally, albeit with some subtle analogue compression and analogue mixing desk throughs at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome album press:\r\n\r\n\"Incredibly intense\" - Pitchfork\r\n\r\n\"Insanely good\" - The FADER\r\n\r\n\"Impossibly gorgeous\" - FACT\r\n\r\n\"Burns with an incredible creative intensity ... sumptuous, enticingly beautiful\" - Clash\r\n\r\n\"Wants you to dance and cry simultaneously, and will probably succeed in doing so\" - DUMMY\r\n\r\n\"Ace\" - theQuietus\r\n\r\n\"A religious experience .. a master at blending blissed-out, lightweight textures with moments of heavy darkness\" - Earmilk\r\n\r\n\"Recalls Philip Glass, Aphex Twin's most serene moments and even Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3\" - Resident Advisor\r\n\r\n\"A quiet elegance that's unique to the genre\" \r\n- XLR8R\r\n\r\n\"Some of the more ambitious and exploratory music crafted within the last few years\" \r\n- The Music Ninja\r\n\r\n\"One of today's most innovative electronic musicians\" - DJZ","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142212919","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/potency-clip-from-human-lp-out","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000075068840-yac2tv-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/WEiieGqhyvlV_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142212919/stream","playback_count":32886,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":612,"comment_count":62,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142212919/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":139843924,"created_at":"2014/03/16 12:06:21 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":210226,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":37070420,"last_modified":"2015/08/31 21:30:08 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Awakening Human LP Album sun rising ambient chill glitch clicks","permalink":"awakening-clip-from-human","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://btprt.dj/TC7WHJ","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"electronica","title":"Awakening (clip) from HUMAN album Out Now","description":"Taken from \"Human,\" out now.\r\n\r\niTunes www.smarturl.it/MCHuman / Beatport: smarturl.it/HumanBeatport\r\nVinyl + CD bit.ly/FIELDSshop\r\n\r\nThis track is the last one on my album, and it's supposed to be some sort of pleasant/easy closure after all of the hammering, and also the exit from the album as an awakening back to reality.\r\n\r\nThe track was originally designed around the idea of being asleep, and then being woken by rays of sun hitting your face.

It comprises 16 columns with omnidirectional speakers at several heights in each column, and the columns spaced around the room in a 12 x 12 x 4m array.\r\n\r\nThey have designed Max for Live devices which provide a range of spatial controls within Ableton Live, as well as an accompanying visual 3D model of the space and sounds within it. This allows for a spatial composition/production process, whereby each piece of music is designed as a physical entity to exist within the space, as something that can be walked around inside and explored by the listeners.\r\n\r\nThe system is called \"4D Sound\" because it produces sound in all 3 spatial dimensions, as well as being able to move sounds through the space in time - the 4th dimension.\r\n\r\nMore mixes and info:  www.maxcooper.net\r\nPhoto by Henri Blommers","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137911916","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/headphones-only-woven-ancestry","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000075139577-ouukv4-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/VjNujrJoX7yA_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137911916/stream","playback_count":48720,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1362,"comment_count":108,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137911916/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":137035020,"created_at":"2014/02/27 15:10:34 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":190189,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":33535360,"last_modified":"2015/09/14 23:02:43 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Numb Kathrin deBoer vocal glitch techno house deep bass","permalink":"numb-feat-kathrin-deboer-1","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.smarturl.it/MCHuman","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"order on iTunes","genre":"electronica","title":"Numb feat.

Perc Remix","description":"Available from: http://www.beatport.com/release/impacts/1228072\r\n\r\nAnd now the Perc remix. Highly original and totally uncompromising - Perc has pulled out something heavy for his mix. No doubt this isn't something you'll all be into, but for me it's a breath of fresh air to hear something so different, hats off to Perc for pushing the boundaries.\r\n\r\nAnd it sounds insane on a big system, I'd recommend headphone listening to catch the low action....puts a smile on my face (and scared looks on many others)....\r\n\r\nps Don't bother listening if you're looking for something pleasant or comprehensible for your ears today!\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for this abomination lacking softness or melody though - the album is called \"Human\", and it's my attempt to translate some common themes about the human condition, into musical form. And of course not everything about being human is beautiful or pleasant - we experience all sorts of things, and this one is about the impacts of life, in the form of pounding mechanical collisions. It's a club track really, and if you've seen me in recent months you've probably had your face smashed by it a little - sorry about that!\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the Quietus for featuring this Perc remix, which takes the track to whole new labels of abrasion.\r\n\r\nHere is the full press info in case needed -\r\n\r\nAn album that sets out to examine sonic extremes, Max Cooper's debut Human juxtaposes a whole range of electronic styles: lush orchestration fighting savage distortion, and clinical digital sound anchored by warm analogue grooves. And nowhere is that restless curiosity to experiment as apparent as the contrast of the first and second singles - first, the delicate and downtempo Adrift, versus this second release, Impacts, the roughest, toughest sampler workout Cooper has produced.\r\n\r\nOn the album, they're sequenced in a focused line to be the centre of the album's first act and then its midpoint, before the album's more experimental final act. But as a single on its own? Impacts is a stop-start stomper that has had festival crowds asking WTF!?!? for months now, and the album's only purely dancefloor moment - as far from voguish k-house sounds as it is.\r\n\r\nBut despite the harsh uncompromising sonic contrast - and this is a track that grunts into focus like a sledgehammer picking a fight with a gang of hi-hats - Impacts is, to Cooper's mind, actually something very optimistic. It's the sound of a person beaten again and again by life, but each time bouncing back and wanting more.\r\n\r\nFor the remixes, Cooper has gone for two artists with their own take on high-contrast sonics. Gabe Gurnsey of Factory Floor has folded his band's hypnotic acid tweaking into the original's rasping beats, and Perc has gone balls out with an take-it-or-leave it experimental sub-lead mix for the serious heads and big systems.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128260396","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/impacts-perc-remix","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000067243522-jya9ww-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/yNSkaZ3wf69m_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128260396/stream","playback_count":26520,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":359,"comment_count":48,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128260396/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":128258703,"created_at":"2014/01/07 01:52:53 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":497521,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":20507523,"last_modified":"2015/08/27 19:10:42 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"impacts-factory-floor-remix","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/impacts/1228072","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Techno","title":"Impacts - Factory Floor Gabe Gurnsey Remix","description":"Available from: http://www.beatport.com/release/impacts/1228072\r\n\r\nAnd here's the remix!  \r\n\r\nSo, it's my next album single, and this time it's a bit crunching.

I wanted to keep the focus firmly on the piano and just introduce some subtle electronic elements, while looping Tom's short sections to give a full arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe percussive clicks came from a visit to Manchester when I played at WHP. The day after a friend was kind enough to offer us free tickets to see Manchester United play Fulham in the FA cup, so I brought my binaural mics along to capture the sound of the huge crowd. I'm not quite ready to introduce huge crowd cheering noises into my tracks (maybe the EDM career can begin next year), but I found that even when the sound of the crowd was cut down to little fragments using Monolake's Granulator, they still had a nice quality. So the percussion on this track are made from the sound of Old Trafford, and there are some points in the track (right at the end for example) where I open the release a little and you can here some crowd coming through.\r\n\r\nYou can buy the full release on iTunes at http://www.smarturl.it/FragmentedTwo","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118523975","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/amorphous-romance-with-tom","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000062128383-smwtdi-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/cpNiWz9CXS6x_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118523975/stream","playback_count":94077,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":2799,"comment_count":177,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118523975/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":117603449,"created_at":"2013/10/29 12:36:51 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":315430,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":13081366,"last_modified":"2015/10/05 19:42:36 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Max Cooper\" \"Tom Hodge\" Fragments Self EP Fragmented Piano Modern Post Classical Glitch Techno Ambient Extremes Opposites Combined","permalink":"fragments-of-self-with-tom","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/FragmentedOne","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Buy on Beatport","genre":"electronica","title":"Fragments of Self - with Tom Hodge - Out Now on FIELDS","description":"This track is about emergence from the combination of polar opposites. Fragments of self from very different places, but part of the same whole.\r\n\r\nCombining classical and computational elements is something I've been experimenting with for some years, but this attempt to combine the extreme opposites of each was spurred on by some chance DJing experiments, a fortuitous collaboration opportunity, and the amazing work of my friends Olafur Arnalds and Vaetxh (Rob Clouth). I found that I could mix the most beautiful and delicate piano solo of Olafur, with the most hyper-edited and jarring glitch of Vaetxh, and that the result actually worked, well, for me anyway, even if half the people in the club stood confused about how to dance. So when the opportunity arose to work with the pianist and composer Tom Hodge, I wanted to try and create this form of merger of extremes for a release, rather than it being confined to my DJ toolbox (also on the classical meets glitch history from a slightly different angle, check out \"Rossz Csillag Alatt Született\" from Venetian Snares 2005!).\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion of ideas and approach with Tom, he sat and played and made some recordings for me, which I then chopped and build chords and structure around, sent them back to him to play over the top of again, and then back to me to edit and glitch the playing along with the nasty noises. My detailing process was that of finding some interesting sound sources (binaural recordings, drum hit samples, clangs and slams etc) and using some Max for live randomisation chains to generate lots of partially random complexity which I could then edit as audio before repeating the process with additional layers, eventually bringing the recorded piano audio in to the editing too.\r\n\r\nAt completion of the audio I was really happy to find out that Nick Cobby, one of my favourite video artists and long standing collaborator, was available and interested in working on the visual side of the project. He took the combination of seemingly incompatible opposites, and applied it visually with his beautiful generative forms, smooth and organic for the melodic sections, and jagged and abrasive for the percussive sections - big thanks to Nick for his amazing work as always!\r\n\r\nSo, that's probably enough ranting about this track from me, aside from why it is like it is, I hope it's something that you can enjoy irrespective of the conceptual faff.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/fragments-of-self-with-tom","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000061357030-4varyi-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/DrGQSMP1yOFU_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449/stream","playback_count":87653,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1832,"comment_count":155,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449/attachments"}]
