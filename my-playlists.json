There will be 6 parts, and every one of them will be free for members of the site.\n\nThis first track, called Arc, was one of my first experiments with some new analogue synths recently - the Moog Minituar, and the Dave Smith Instruments Prophet 08. I wanted to make something smooth and melodic which would work for my club sets, and would be mixable, but nothing too peak time intense, something a little softer. I think the heart of the track really all came down to squeesing the main riff with those lovely analogue filters!\n\nIf you would like to download this track, and receive promos of the rest of the new music before it goes public, then just click on the download button on the soundcloud player and all will be explained. In return for your email you will receive all 6 parts of the series for free, and they will not be released on any other platforms.\n\nThanks to Rabbithole for the excellent art work!","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176428370","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/arc-free-download-quotient-series-16","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000096839310-i72rq8-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/X0vv0tGAaDsJ_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176428370/stream","playback_count":62139,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1477,"comment_count":66,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176428370/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":178585246,"created_at":"2014/11/25 15:27:08 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":4412990,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":178286909,"last_modified":"2015/09/28 13:54:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Semiosis \"Max Cooper\" Dj Set Quotient Series number 2 of 6","permalink":"semiosis-dj-set-quotient-26","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DL FROM HERE","genre":"Ratio","title":"Semiosis - DJ Set - Free DL - Quotient 2/6","description":"I’ve been pretty obsessed with simple ratios in the forms of chord progressions for as long as I can remember, hence all the long sustained chords in my music - for some reason I find chords even more satisfying in the lower frequencies, maybe we can pick out the ratios more clearly when they’re using slower wave fronts like with bass. I also love melodies and rhythms that combine different loop lengths so that interesting syncopation effects arise as a result of the ratios between the loop lengths. A lot of my favourite new tracks recently have used these types of techniques, so I decided to base a mix around them - Semiosis.\n\nSemiosis is a process by which we create meaning from comparison. If I tell you a made up word that doesn’t relate to anything you know, you can get little meaning from it - meaning comes from what something isn’t, how it relates to other things you know. Music works in exactly this way, with us comparing meaningless wave frequencies to find feeling in how one value relates to another - a ratio.\n\nWhether or not you like it, your subconscious mind is a massive maths geek, and it gets really excited when it finds a 1:3:5 ratio in the stream of air pressure information being received by your ears.  Ratio has the capacity to make us feel and make us dance. But it all happens without us being aware of it. \n\nWhen you listen to long drawn out chords and syncopating rhythms however, you can’t really get the full feeling from just a quick dip in, I find that it needs time for the ratios to wash over and sink in. The more time you give to it the more beauty you can find hidden in there. So the mix is very much of this long form, it doesn’t jump from one extreme to another like some of my other mixes, and needs to have some time to develop.\n\nThis is part 2 of 6 from the Quotient Series, all of which can be downloaded for free in return for signing up to my new download website, built specifically for bringing you new original tracks, remixes and mixes, which you won't be able to get from anywhere else. \n\nYou can find the website here: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nMax Cooper - Semiosis - DJ Set - Quotient 2/6\n\n1.

Partly because it was the result of a chance string of events driven by my love of the original track and a fortuitous meeting with Frederic D. Oberland, one half of The Rustle of the Stars with Richard Knox. And partly because I love the intensity and feeling of the original which I have tried to convey in my own way with little regard for the usual rules of making music - ambient strings arrangement at one end, and a drum and bass wall of sound at the other, because that's what I felt was required to communicate the emotions I found in the original piece, inspired by \"a musical passage through the North Pole explorer diaries\".  \n \nHere's what Richard and Frederic said about the original:  \"We would like to think of this as a polar journey to the ends of the earth through the arctic sea. We kept in mind the first polar expeditions, Edgar Allan Poe's Dream-Land, the ships trapped or crushed by ice, the point of no-return, the minds sinking, the attempt on the Pole ending in disaster, the quest of the Northwest Passage, Erebus & Terror, the Mercy Bay, Mangazeya, Charles Francis Hall, Beechey Island, the Midnight sun and the Polar night.\"\n \nIt's very winter-y. And I'm very pleased Richard and Frederic agreed to allow me to give the remix away for free to anyone who would like to hear it this Christmas!\n\nThe Rustle of the Stars - Sleeping Land (Part 1) - Max Cooper Remix\n\nYou can find the beautiful full album from the Rustle of the Stars, here: http://www.therustleofthestars.com/ ","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/the-rustle-of-the-stars-sleeping-land-max-cooper-rmx-quotient-36","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000101468575-3r6wls-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/k8vOyLASe30o_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313/stream","playback_count":59111,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1510,"comment_count":86,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183323313/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":191927816,"created_at":"2015/02/19 13:33:59 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":213282,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":9488895,"last_modified":"2015/09/28 13:54:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Piano solo \"feedback matrix\" \"max cooper\" \"tom hodge\" post Classical modern Artefact Ep \"Part 1\" Downtempo Electronic","permalink":"teotihuacan-part-1","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DOWNLOAD HERE","genre":"Quotient Series","title":"Teotihuacan - Part 1 - with Tom Hodge - Quotient 4/6","description":"When I was touring in Mexico, I was lucky enough to have some days off during a visit to Mexico City, and took a trip to a nearby Toltec/Aztec Pyramid site called Teotihuacan. It's a beautiful place, but when I asked about its history I was told that most of the knowledge and culture of the people who built it was lost, with the arrival of the Europeans. Now it's turned into a rebuilt money making tourist trap, with the loss of its real meaning.\n\nI recorded the space and sounds there with binaural mics, so I could try and capture some of the feeling of it, including a storm which came in, and then I wrote a strings part inspired by the feelings of the visit there. Tom Hodge brought the piece to life by playing a piano part in addition, and I loved the piano so much I decided to make two parts, the first with the piano only, combined with the binaural recordings and a randomising delay feedback network, and the second part with the strings. The first part of Teotihuacan is available exclusively from the free download Quotient Series, and the second part will be coming on the Artefact EP in April.\n\npreorder available - www.smarturl.it/ArtefactEP‏","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/teotihuacan-part-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000107281329-px5af0-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ne6fXNxEU3D5_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/stream","playback_count":98525,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1264,"comment_count":45,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":209703376,"created_at":"2015/06/10 15:29:35 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":310729,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":14187372,"last_modified":"2015/09/28 13:54:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Quotient Series Max Cooper Anatomic melodic glitch click techno house electronica human machine","permalink":"anatomic","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DOWNLOAD HERE","genre":"Electronic","title":"Anatomic - Quotient 5/6","description":"I wanted part of my Emergence show to be about the emergence of the human machine, with an infographic-style visual tour of the different modules of the human body - lungs, heart, blood vessels, brain, and more.

Alex started off with the main bulk of the ideas for the track, and I initially chopped it all back to a couple of key elements.   I then experimented with some FFT effects and building some chaotic randomising manipulations of the basic elements, and sliding drum rhythms so that one drum element would slip relative to another and then back in - all an attempt to generate some movement and variation from the simple building blocks.\"\n\nAlex:   \"It was interesting to hear the rough ideas I had created, developed in a totally different way to how they would have had I been writing the track by myself.

They were having a lot of fun during the recordings and I think it comes through.\n\nThe fun we were having making the recordings was aided by the fact that Gearbox records (who are releasing the EP 6th Oct on vinyl, and 3rd Nov on digital) had provided Mark Ronson's recording studio for us to work in, so it was a pleasure all round.\n\nThere are 3 more tracks to come from the release, 2 ambient, and one absolute abomination where I wanted to see what would happen if I made the most f*&ked up track I could and then asked them to improvise over it - more clips and info coming soon.\n\nIf you want to catch Quentin Collins playing, he does regular gigs in London at Ronnie Scotts, amongst other places. And Kathrin deBoer has also launched a new solo project under her name, which is also touring and highly recommended.","label_name":"Gearbox Recs","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170174811","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/chronology-with-quentin-collins-kathrin-deboer-and-jack-stephens","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000092651644-ql1au2-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/xr9bA1zZGveN_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170174811/stream","playback_count":199301,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":4381,"comment_count":135,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170174811/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":200147321,"created_at":"2015/04/10 11:32:43 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":195230,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":7807476,"last_modified":"2015/09/26 01:02:52 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"tom hodge\" \"max cooper\" artefact Ep fields piano beautiful Electronic electronica post classical Atmospheric","permalink":"remnants-with-tom-hodge-preview-clip","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Buy Full Length","genre":"memories","title":"Remnants - with Tom Hodge - Preview Clip","description":"I've been working on some new music with Tom Hodge, combining piano and electronic elements - the first track preview is below, with the full release coming 20th April.\n\nFor this track we made the drums from clanging around inside a broken piano, and then applying some complex editing, so they have an interesting partially live feel, even though rhythmically they are very electronic.\n\nThe piano came from a live jam over an initial chord structure, then lots of editing to find that one simple little hook in there.

But aside from all that, this was just a really enjoyable remix to work on because the original is such a great piece of music, and seemingly so well suited to what I wanted to do with it - which was to try and turn Nils' instrumental jam on his Juno, into something house/techno/club/44 compatible, but still carrying the class and feeling of the original. It was one of those remixes that just seemed to fit and flow easily, with minimum strain and maximum enjoyment on my part - usually a good sign for a remix (the one's that have to be forced never seem to quite get there).\r\n\r\nNot only is this one of the best remix projects I've been lucky enough to be involved with, it's also available totally free for you to download and share as you like, courtesy of Erased Tapes and Decibel festival where myself and Nils played last weekend, as well as XLR8R, who were good enough to first feature it at at http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2013/10/download-max-coopers-new-remix-n\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it's also a thank you to YOU for listening an supporting my work over the years....thank you and I hope you like the track!.... \r\n\r\nps if you're in London on the 18th, Nils is playing an Erased Tapes showcase at Village Underground.

After the release a builder of sansula instruments in the Netherlands was kind enough to give me one as a present in case I wanted to use one again in a live recording, which I have finally got around to doing now with this track!\n\nMy process consisted of me sitting in my studio (badly) playing the thumb plucked sansula for quite a while, so that I could go back to the recording and pull out some useable loops as a starting point. I wanted a nice warm analogue chord progression to complement, but more in the high bass and low mids than my usual chord progression that's down really low, to fill the mix with the warmth as much as possible.\n\nThe track still needed something though, so I turned to some spare recordings of my favourite vocalist - Kathrin deBoer, from some of our previous recording sessions. I didn't want to go for the usual full lyrical approach of a vocal collab track, I just wanted to add some small snippets of human feeling to round off the track properly.\n\nThe release is coming out on Fields on the 1st of December along with an intense synth experiment with a Prophet 08, and beautiful remixes from David August and Throwing Snow.\n\nIf you're not into buying music there is also a new website I have just launched which will be providing exclusive new free downloads for all in return for signing up to the website - http://www.maxcooper.net/downloads","label_name":"FIELDS","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2014,"release_month":12,"release_day":1,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/origins-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000098158007-s9wn0w-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/eba72QyTBdGt_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262/stream","playback_count":360704,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":7382,"comment_count":203,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177639262/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":201848779,"created_at":"2015/04/21 11:44:55 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":7120601,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":285240679,"last_modified":"2016/01/21 15:55:57 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"max cooper\" electronica techno classical glitch piano fields traum \"nils frahm\" lusine \"tim hecker\" burial \"boards of canada\" \"drum and bass\" bbc \"radio 1\" \"pete tong\" kiasmos \"rob clouth\"","permalink":"essential-mix-max-cooper-no-voice-overs","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://btprt.dj/1DHZhHk","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"New EP Here","genre":"Essential Mix","title":"Essential Mix - Max Cooper - No Voice Overs","description":"I've been listening to Essential mixes since I first started getting into clubs and electronic music, so it was a shock, and exciting for me, to get the offer to make one myself. The two hour format really allows some time to explore ideas musically as well.\n\nSo bringing everything together, I decided to try and make it an exploration of everything that has made me so obsessed with electronic music for the last 20 years, with some of my favourite records from the mid 90's, unreleased material from my favourite artists like Nils Frahm, Lusine, Tim Hecker and Rob Clouth, and a range of genres from ambient to 90 bpm electronica, house and techno, all the way up to 170bpm glitched jungle mayhem - I thought, why not have some fun with it!?\n\nSo it's certainly not a normal club mix, it's just what I think is the best music out there, without worrying about what genre or box any particular track fits into or how things should be done \"properly\". I wanted to leave some sections quite ambient as well, to give breathing space between the peaks, so I'm happy to be able to post this new version up, minus the broadcast talking and idents.\n\nThe mix also contains some new work from me, some unreleased, and two tracks from my new EP with Tom Hodge, one of which you can download for free from here www.maxcooper.net, the other you can download from iTunes - http://hyperurl.co/MCartefactEP - or Beatport - http://btprt.dj/1DHZhHk\n\nTrack List\n\n1.

Alex started off with the main bulk of the ideas for the track, and I initially chopped it all back to a couple of key elements.

Inspired by the new direction the track was going in - \"\n\nMax:  \"I'd made a mess.

It's a beautiful place, but when I asked about its history I was told that most of the knowledge and culture of the people who built it was lost, with the arrival of the Europeans. Now it's turned into a rebuilt money making tourist trap, with the loss of its real meaning.\n\nI recorded the space and sounds there with binaural mics, so I could try and capture some of the feeling of it, including a storm which came in, and then I wrote a strings part inspired by the feelings of the visit there. Tom Hodge brought the piece to life by playing a piano part in addition, and I loved the piano so much I decided to make two parts, the first with the piano only, combined with the binaural recordings and a randomising delay feedback network, and the second part with the strings. The first part of Teotihuacan is available exclusively from the free download Quotient Series, and the second part will be coming on the Artefact EP in April.\n\npreorder available - www.smarturl.it/ArtefactEP‏","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/teotihuacan-part-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000107281329-px5af0-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ne6fXNxEU3D5_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/stream","playback_count":98525,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1264,"comment_count":45,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191927816/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":178585246,"created_at":"2014/11/25 15:27:08 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":4412990,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":178286909,"last_modified":"2015/09/28 13:54:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Semiosis \"Max Cooper\" Dj Set Quotient Series number 2 of 6","permalink":"semiosis-dj-set-quotient-26","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/CooperSound","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"FREE DL FROM HERE","genre":"Ratio","title":"Semiosis - DJ Set - Free DL - Quotient 2/6","description":"I’ve been pretty obsessed with simple ratios in the forms of chord progressions for as long as I can remember, hence all the long sustained chords in my music - for some reason I find chords even more satisfying in the lower frequencies, maybe we can pick out the ratios more clearly when they’re using slower wave fronts like with bass. I also love melodies and rhythms that combine different loop lengths so that interesting syncopation effects arise as a result of the ratios between the loop lengths. A lot of my favourite new tracks recently have used these types of techniques, so I decided to base a mix around them - Semiosis.\n\nSemiosis is a process by which we create meaning from comparison. If I tell you a made up word that doesn’t relate to anything you know, you can get little meaning from it - meaning comes from what something isn’t, how it relates to other things you know. Music works in exactly this way, with us comparing meaningless wave frequencies to find feeling in how one value relates to another - a ratio.\n\nWhether or not you like it, your subconscious mind is a massive maths geek, and it gets really excited when it finds a 1:3:5 ratio in the stream of air pressure information being received by your ears.  Ratio has the capacity to make us feel and make us dance. But it all happens without us being aware of it. \n\nWhen you listen to long drawn out chords and syncopating rhythms however, you can’t really get the full feeling from just a quick dip in, I find that it needs time for the ratios to wash over and sink in. The more time you give to it the more beauty you can find hidden in there. So the mix is very much of this long form, it doesn’t jump from one extreme to another like some of my other mixes, and needs to have some time to develop.\n\nThis is part 2 of 6 from the Quotient Series, all of which can be downloaded for free in return for signing up to my new download website, built specifically for bringing you new original tracks, remixes and mixes, which you won't be able to get from anywhere else. \n\nYou can find the website here: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nMax Cooper - Semiosis - DJ Set - Quotient 2/6\n\n1.

After the release a builder of sansula instruments in the Netherlands was kind enough to give me one as a present in case I wanted to use one again in a live recording, which I have finally got around to doing now with this track!\n\nMy process consisted of me sitting in my studio (badly) playing the thumb plucked sansula for quite a while, so that I could go back to the recording and pull out some useable loops as a starting point. I wanted a nice warm analogue chord progression to complement, but more in the high bass and low mids than my usual chord progression that's down really low, to fill the mix with the warmth as much as possible.\n\nThe track still needed something though, so I turned to some spare recordings of my favourite vocalist - Kathrin deBoer, from some of our previous recording sessions. I didn't want to go for the usual full lyrical approach of a vocal collab track, I just wanted to add some small snippets of human feeling to round off the track properly.\n\nThe release is coming out on Fields on the 1st of December along with an intense synth experiment with a Prophet 08, and beautiful remixes from David August and Throwing Snow.\n\nIf you're not into buying music there is also a new website I have just launched which will be providing exclusive new free downloads for all in return for signing up to the website -

In fact, we ended up with such a great bunch of remixes, we decided to split them into two packages, so we could all take in each one of their works with enough time for the proper consideration they deserve.\r\n\r\nThis time we have Lusine, Rodriguez Jr and Harvey McKay. Lusine is one of my all-time-favourite producers, and has been for many years. His \"A Certain Distance\" LP being one of the most listened to albums in my collection, and his use of detail, complexity, warm synths and beautiful melodies, a big inspiration for me over the years.\r\n\r\nRodriguez Jr has always featured heavily in my DJ sets, with his soft and massive at the same time productions, and a knack for writing tracks that seem to work anywhere in the world and on any sound system - that is f'ing hard to do!....He's a master of tight productions, as demonstrated by his beautiful remix of Supine on this release - hats off to Olivier.\r\n\r\nHarvey McKay has basically stamped on everyone in the last year or two (in the best possible way!) with his brand of crunchy saturated techno hugeness. He's got some amazing way of making this rolling wall of sound that's got aggression and groove in a lovely balance - if you ever hear this remix of his on a big system it all becomes clear!","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/33101589","label_name":"","tag_list":"Max Cooper Inhuman Human LP albumm remixes Rodriguez Jr Harvey McKay Lusine melodic bassline deep techno","release_year":null,"track_count":3,"user_id":79981,"last_modified":"2014/05/02 11:51:15 +0000","license":"all-rights-reserved","tracks":[{"kind":"track","id":146275800,"created_at":"2014/04/24 17:02:13 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":320603,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":13219136,"last_modified":"2016/01/27 22:11:37 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Woven Ancestry Lusine Remix Human album Fields LP Inhuman","permalink":"woven-ancestry-lusine-remix-1","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/inhuman-one/1280972","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"electronica","title":"Woven Ancestry - Lusine Remix","description":"Out Now! >> http://www.beatport.com/release/inhuman-one/1280972\r\n\r\nLusine has been one of my favourite producers for a long time.

The mix has special balance of being a great piece of music to listen to at home, but then when it's unleashed in a club it's groove takes on a whole new life which I hadn't seen coming until I tried it out - Thanks Jeff!\r\n\r\nMax","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/woven-ancestry-lusine-remix-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000077470267-0ehhet-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ggSZkNvcRQRz_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800/stream","playback_count":214470,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":5793,"comment_count":178,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146275800/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":147209765,"created_at":"2014/04/30 12:05:01 +0000","user_id":324581,"duration":256389,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":10253582,"last_modified":"2015/12/24 08:27:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"max cooper\" \"rodriguez jr\" fields supine Remix","permalink":"max-cooper-supine-rodriguez-jr-remix","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/inhuman-one/1280972","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"","title":"Max Cooper - Supine (Rodriguez Jr. Remix - Clip)","description":"INHUMAN is the remix EP of Max Cooper's critically acclaimed debut HUMAN.

The result is the new Fragmented Self EP, which is out now on Fields.\r\n\r\nWe explored a few different possibilities ranging from the attempt to fuse extreme opposites in the title track Fragments of Self, to the distorted mayhem of falling off a cliff, and Quantet, where I chopped Tom’s orchestral session into tiny pieces and built something unnatural.\r\n\r\nThe EP comes with a remix from one of my favourite artists at the moment – Petrels, if you don’t know his stuff already I highly recommend a listen. He’s done an amazing job on the remix of Fragments of Self, stripping away those nasty glitches and getting down to the nice stuff in a really live organic sort of way.\r\n\r\nThe EP comes in two parts, with the second part coming in a few weeks, AND, a music video from Nick Cobby for Fragements of Self, which is pretty stupendous (that good!).

Fragments of self from very different places, but part of the same whole.\r\n\r\nCombining classical and computational elements is something I've been experimenting with for some years, but this attempt to combine the extreme opposites of each was spurred on by some chance DJing experiments, a fortuitous collaboration opportunity, and the amazing work of my friends Olafur Arnalds and Vaetxh (Rob Clouth). I found that I could mix the most beautiful and delicate piano solo of Olafur, with the most hyper-edited and jarring glitch of Vaetxh, and that the result actually worked, well, for me anyway, even if half the people in the club stood confused about how to dance. So when the opportunity arose to work with the pianist and composer Tom Hodge, I wanted to try and create this form of merger of extremes for a release, rather than it being confined to my DJ toolbox (also on the classical meets glitch history from a slightly different angle, check out \"Rossz Csillag Alatt Született\" from Venetian Snares 2005!).\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion of ideas and approach with Tom, he sat and played and made some recordings for me, which I then chopped and build chords and structure around, sent them back to him to play over the top of again, and then back to me to edit and glitch the playing along with the nasty noises. My detailing process was that of finding some interesting sound sources (binaural recordings, drum hit samples, clangs and slams etc) and using some Max for live randomisation chains to generate lots of partially random complexity which I could then edit as audio before repeating the process with additional layers, eventually bringing the recorded piano audio in to the editing too.\r\n\r\nAt completion of the audio I was really happy to find out that Nick Cobby, one of my favourite video artists and long standing collaborator, was available and interested in working on the visual side of the project. He took the combination of seemingly incompatible opposites, and applied it visually with his beautiful generative forms, smooth and organic for the melodic sections, and jagged and abrasive for the percussive sections - big thanks to Nick for his amazing work as always!\r\n\r\nSo, that's probably enough ranting about this track from me, aside from why it is like it is, I hope it's something that you can enjoy irrespective of the conceptual faff.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/fragments-of-self-with-tom","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000061357030-4varyi-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/DrGQSMP1yOFU_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449/stream","playback_count":87653,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1832,"comment_count":155,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117603449/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":117023585,"created_at":"2013/10/25 16:20:13 +0000","user_id":545820,"duration":437147,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":77246780,"last_modified":"2015/09/29 21:38:13 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Tom Hodge\" Piano Remix Techno \"Max Cooper\"","permalink":"max-cooper-tom-hodge-fragments","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"remix","title":"Max Cooper & Tom Hodge - Fragments of Self (Petrels Remix)","description":"https://www.facebook.com/Petrels\r\nhttp://petrels.bandcamp.com/\r\nhttp://floatinglimb.com/\r\nhttps://twitter.com/bowed_idly\r\n\r\nRemix of the track 'Fragments of Self' from 'Fragmented Self' by Max Cooper and Tom Hodge.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fieldsldn.net/\r\n\r\nWhen trying to make creative decisions based on the results of somebody else's process it makes you try things out that perhaps you wouldn't normally think of and I'd say with every remix I've ever done I've come away with something new.  Sometimes its interesting to take a track in a completely new direction but in the case of Max and Tom's collaboration I was immediately drawn to the subtle harmonic undercurrent of the synth lines beneath the main piano parts and figured it would be interesting to put together an arrangement that brought that to the fore. \r\n\r\nI started with a rough layering and overlay of the piano samples - trying to re-arrange them into different combinations than in the original to create something that had the same feel (on a side note, its always pleasing to work with recordings like this of instruments that sound played - i.e., you can hear the movement of the pedals and the fingers on the keys rather than a surgically-extracted sequence of notes) but that came to the main melodies from a different angle.  I can't really compete with Max's glitchy rhythmic production and since this is so distinctive it seemed like a bit of a cop-out to make too much use of these samples in any case so in the end the main part of what I used of the rhythm was a short kick drum sample that I processed in various ways to create the studded melodic cross-rhythm that I used for most of the middle of the track.\r\n\r\nWith the bare bones in place the majority of the rest of the work came from layering up the arrangement with the kinds of synths and strings that I make use of in my Petrels stuff.  Like I said, I was drawn to the low root synth line in the original that casts a subtle melodic shade over the piano lines so using this as a starting point I slowly built up the orchestration around it so as to make it much more of a focal point.  In the end, hopefully the result is something akin to a huge group of assorted musicians attempting a spontaneous live version of what essentially started as a duet performance. Well that was the idea anyhow.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"remix","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"wav","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117023585","user":{"id":545820,"kind":"user","permalink":"floatinglimb","username":"Floating Limb","last_modified":"2015/11/16 16:25:44 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/545820","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/floatinglimb","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000038309550-2qmx16-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/floatinglimb/max-cooper-tom-hodge-fragments","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000061039668-exn5xw-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/Y2VIQNUEryN9_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117023585/stream","playback_count":66880,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1132,"comment_count":71,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117023585/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":116870255,"created_at":"2013/10/24 17:00:27 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":381136,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":15709284,"last_modified":"2016/01/26 09:45:08 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Tom Hodge Von Der Klippe Fallen Falling Off Cliff Saturation Heavy Techno Distortion Piano Classical Death","permalink":"max-cooper-and-tom-hodge-von","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"me","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/fragmented-self-ep-pt-1/1161889","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"electronica","title":"Von Der Klippe Fallen - with Tom Hodge - FIELDS","description":"This track is about having a walk on a nice sunny day in the countryside, all is well and good, until you accidentally fall off a cliff.

All I had to do was layer up some of the multiple instances of her voice, and add my reverbs and widening with some subtle EQing and compression, and it was there - she captured the pure feeling of the music and enhanced it a million times, and I love the free-flowing feeling of it, with its imperfections and half words, and of course, he subconscious vocal of not feeling any more lead to the title and concise concept for the music.\r\n\r\nWe knew that we had to get a video made to match Kathrin's work, and I was really excited to find out that Henning M. Lederer, who I had been a big fan of for some time, could do the project. We discussed options together and decided to try a \"numbed by the capitalist machine\" theme, which he has developed into an amazing, detailed story with a twist.

Kathrin deBoer - Falling Into Recursive Space (clip)","description":"This is the second idea I worked on with Kathrin deBoer for the Conditions Two EP, and an attempt to make something surreal. I tried to use her voice as an instrument in the track, rather than presenting it as a normal vocal at the forefront of the mix. I used lots of Max for Live fiddling’s to mangle up her vocals into all sorts of weird noises, and then picked out some of my favourites to use in the track. Most of the noises that aren’t the drums and main synths, so pretty much all the weird noises in the track, are made from Kathrin’s voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall feeling was something soft and organic, where in addition to the unpredictability and non-loopy manner of the vocal effects, the drums also follow a loose and slightly randomised pattern, with lots of shuffle to add to the free feeling. I thought the approach made it end up sounding a bit maddening and messy, and there was also a strong feeling of space in there with the main pads, so this combined with the surrealist approach lead me to the name ‘Falling Into Recursive Space’.\r\n\r\nFor Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nsoundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nwww.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nwww.maxcooper.net/","label_name":"FIELDS","release":"FLDS002","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90273044","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/max-cooper-feat-kathrin-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000046927132-w0felq-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/6CE9UdWg2tM6_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90273044/stream","playback_count":43477,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":765,"comment_count":58,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90273044/attachments"}],"playlist_type":"","id":5317771,"downloadable":false,"sharing":"public","created_at":"2013/05/02 13:18:13 +0000","release":"","kind":"playlist","title":"Conditions Two","type":"","purchase_title":null,"created_with":{"permalink_url":"http://developers.soundcloud.com/","name":"SoundCloud.com","external_url":"","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/apps/46941","creator":"soundcloud","id":46941,"kind":"app"},"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000047021526-yniq84-large.jpg","ean":"","streamable":true,"user":{"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","id":79981,"kind":"user","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"embeddable_by":"all","label_id":null},{"duration":1421270,"release_day":null,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/movements-ep","genre":"","permalink":"movements-ep","purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/movements-ep/1055134","release_month":null,"description":"So, here is my latest experiment on Traum Schallplatten!\r\n\r\nThis EP is themed with movements through different mediums, and for two of the tracks I worked with Nicolas Bougaieff, one of the founders of Liine (who make Lemur, Griid, Remiix and other great music apps).\r\n\r\nFracture is about moving though fractured space.

We used to do this 6 deck show with all sorts of turntablism and on-the-fly bootlegs and stuff like that, back when people still were interested in what you could do with some turntables and mixers. Jeet had this particular bootleg idea layering up some snare driven tracks, which we then recorded and glitched up - it was a monster!....so,  years later we realised that we should try and create an original track in that format, and this is the result - something of a reminder of Xircus/Thrash Jelly, and the mayhem of the closing set at the Garvey. And also a sound which is hopefully relevant now with the kick-focused groove, and in fitting with my other work via the glitch aspect. It was a lot of fun to work on, and is no doubt the hardest track I've ever made, if you're into my deep melodic stuff then I suggest you don't listen as you might be offended!\n\nRelease date is 280612 on Stephan Bodzin's Herzblut label, with the Bside track \"Ruptured\". My manager was a bit concerned I might offend people with the EP tracks \"Fisted\" and \"Ruptured\", but I think the music itself is a bit offensive too so the titles will hopefully be fitting at least. I wanted to call the whole package \"Thrust\" EP, haha, but that was deemed going too far, so we settled on \"Mechanical Concussion\" EP, to focus a little more on the industrial aspect.

I also love melodies and rhythms that combine different loop lengths so that interesting syncopation effects arise as a result of the ratios between the loop lengths. A lot of my favourite new tracks recently have used these types of techniques, so I decided to base a mix around them - Semiosis.\n\nSemiosis is a process by which we create meaning from comparison. If I tell you a made up word that doesn’t relate to anything you know, you can get little meaning from it - meaning comes from what something isn’t, how it relates to other things you know. Music works in exactly this way, with us comparing meaningless wave frequencies to find feeling in how one value relates to another - a ratio.\n\nWhether or not you like it, your subconscious mind is a massive maths geek, and it gets really excited when it finds a 1:3:5 ratio in the stream of air pressure information being received by your ears.  Ratio has the capacity to make us feel and make us dance. But it all happens without us being aware of it. \n\nWhen you listen to long drawn out chords and syncopating rhythms however, you can’t really get the full feeling from just a quick dip in, I find that it needs time for the ratios to wash over and sink in. The more time you give to it the more beauty you can find hidden in there. So the mix is very much of this long form, it doesn’t jump from one extreme to another like some of my other mixes, and needs to have some time to develop.\n\nThis is part 2 of 6 from the Quotient Series, all of which can be downloaded for free in return for signing up to my new download website, built specifically for bringing you new original tracks, remixes and mixes, which you won't be able to get from anywhere else. \n\nYou can find the website here: http://bit.ly/CooperSound\n\nMax Cooper - Semiosis - DJ Set - Quotient 2/6\n\n1.

But after some new studio additions and work developing new ideas and new experiments, I’ve got enough fresh material to draw on, along with some old, to put together a new live set only composed of my originals, some remixes I’ve done, and I had to include a couple from the Inhuman remix package because there’s some great work on there from Lusine and Rodriguez Jr. among others.\r\n\r\nI’ve approached this mix a little more like my live sets of old, keeping it pretty smooth and letting the tracks do the talking, rather than going too heavy on the genre-swapping and BPM-juggling as I have been doing on other mixes recently. There’s still some (hopefully) unexpected moments though of course, a strings solo, some crunchy glitch, backwards Nyatiti, several brand new never heard before tracks, a homemade desolation bootleg of Spastik, my first ever totally analogue tracks (I’ve only recently taken the plunge into the analogue synth world), and two live Jazz improvisation sessions recorded recently in London.\r\n\r\nThe artwork embedded is made by Andre Britz, who has literally created some \"fluid landscapes\" works, of which he was kind enough to donate a custom piece for this mix - Thanks Andre! You can find him here: https://www.behance.net/Andre\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the mix is about being wrapped up in a warm exploration of feelings and landscapes. It will work best with a nice pair of headphones and an open mind. I hope there’s at least some parts in there you enjoy!\r\n\r\n1. Max Cooper - TBA1\r\n2. Collaboration - TBA2\r\n3.

When I was doing my Post-Doc at UCL I used to go the British Museum to relax, and work in the beautiful library there, so I chose the space for the mix. I wanted to capture the ambient atmosphere in the central courtyard, so I did some binaural recording to include in the mix. I also wanted to make the mix something of an exploration through history and ideas in line with the contents of the museum, so I brought in lots of disparate music spanning the centuries and continents. I also mixed it in a way to be like a journey though the museum, turning corners and regularly coming across something totally different and unexpected, with each track being like a different exhibit. Hence the name of the mix, in that, each piece of music almost has a visual content.\r\n\r\nFor the full track list + more information see the feature:\r\nhttp://www.magneticmag.com/2013/04/sounds-spaces-001-max-cooper-the-british-museum/\r\n\r\nFor more Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nhttp://maxcooper.net/","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/86330204","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/max-cooper-synesthetes-museum","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000045245027-gbpj2p-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/EtDXJBcJy8NS_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/86330204/stream","download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/86330204/download","playback_count":128927,"download_count":15600,"favoritings_count":3690,"comment_count":433,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/86330204/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":68312217,"created_at":"2012/11/21 17:53:10 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":4188265,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":167570703,"last_modified":"2016/01/21 15:55:56 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Live Set Movements Through Self Contained Space Remixes Exclusive new tracks techno ambient electronica deep melodic soft","permalink":"max-cooper-live-movements","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"","title":"Max Cooper Live - Movements Through Self Contained Space (free download)","description":"Here's some of my latest work, with plenty of never heard before exclusives, and an approach in mind to warm you up and provide some escapism from the winter.\r\n\r\nAnd now onto the track listings, I'm afraid there's a lot on here which I can't tell you what it is yet, labels like to keep these things secret yeknow!\r\n\r\n1.

So I picked out a selection of my favourite tracks before leaving, and was constrained to use only these. The difficulty was that I had chosen a load of different genres, so it turned into a puzzle of how to fit them all together into some sort of coherent flow. It was a good way to work in the end as it encouraged me to make edits of lots of the tracks, and also lead to some nice unexpected combinations.\r\n\r\n[Note from Max HQ:  the original of Max feat BRAIDS - Automaton - track 6 can be heard on Max's app:  http://bit.ly/QHzLL5]\r\n\r\nFor more Max Cooper mixes/free downloads:\r\nsoundcloud.com/max-cooper/sets/max-cooper-free-downloads\r\n\r\nAnd music videos here:\r\nwww.youtube.com/user/maxbcooper\r\n\r\nAnd for up to date info on all the goings on, you can join the mailing list on my site if you like:\r\nhttp://maxcooper.net/","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62250429","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/max-cooper-xlr8r-decibel","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031573783-2682cx-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/kAyfEiIZxG37_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62250429/stream","download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62250429/download","playback_count":43375,"download_count":4082,"favoritings_count":1383,"comment_count":181,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62250429/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":57890909,"created_at":"2012/08/28 18:45:34 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":3848615,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":154947323,"last_modified":"2015/10/29 06:04:02 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Live Set Transitions Radio John Digweed Free Download","permalink":"max-cooper-live-transitions","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"","title":"Max Cooper Live - Transitions Mix (free download)","description":"This is a live set I recorded in my studio for John Digweed's Transitions radio show.

It's going out as a collaborative release rather than a straight remix because it's deviated quite far from the original, and also because it forms a more consistant solo release that way.

It even reached no. 49 in the UK charts according to Wikipedia, so I'm officially remixing pop music now (sort of). As with some of my other recent remixes, there was no need (and I probably would have found it impossible anyway) to improve on the track melodically, as it's pretty close to perfection in that sense. I just tried to update the style of it, with some glitchy detailed drums, a sort of dubstep-ish influenced beat structure, a long evolving build throughout, and some distortion. This is being released on the legendary Skint records too, which I'm quite excited about.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/28025600","user":{"id":79981,"kind":"user","permalink":"max-cooper","username":"Max Cooper","last_modified":"2016/01/07 20:12:04 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/79981","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000071003572-p30vez-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":false,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/max-cooper/fc-kahuna-hayling-max-cooper","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000014020478-jyuwwe-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/XMZnAlWIkHOV_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/28025600/stream","playback_count":125568,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":2084,"comment_count":106,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/28025600/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":41105774,"created_at":"2012/03/27 11:46:00 +0000","user_id":79981,"duration":317665,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":12703837,"last_modified":"2015/09/14 17:07:52 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Max Cooper Autumn Haze Egomodal EP Traum Schallplatten Melodic 44","permalink":"max-cooper-autumn-haze","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/egomodal-ep/892772","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"","title":"Max Cooper - Autumn Haze (preview)","description":"This is the A2 track from my new vinyl on Traum Schallpatten - It's a restrained melodic track which I tried to keep pure to it's concept, which was when I was sitting in my studio in Autumn, looking out the windows at the trees and nature which was clouded in mist.
